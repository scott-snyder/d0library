    This  document describes th purpose of the VEES package, its structure 
and methods as well as instructions how to run it.


PURPOSE:
-------
            
    This  package is designed to reconstruct decays of neutral particles into 
pairs of charged particles, such as  Ks -> pi+ pi, Lambda -> p + pi-.  
At present only Ks decay reconstruction is fully implemented, but the 
capability for treating Lambda/lambda_bar decays is foreseen. 
The search for "Vees" can be done in the full volume of the Central Detector
or can be limited to a cone e.g. around a J/psi candidate.

STRUCTURE:
---------

    The PBD file for the  VEES   package is   located in  D0$PBD:VEES.PBD.  
It lists the  following  package  hooks to the d0user framework (sources are 
in D0$B_PHYSICS$VEES):

                     PROCESS EVENT          VEES
                     BEGIN_PROGRAM          VEEINI
                     SETUP_RUN              VEEPAR
                     REDEFINE_EVENT_DUMP    VEEDDF(entry to VEEDMP)
                     DUMP_EVENT             VEEDMP

    The package uses an RCP  file, namely  VEES.RCP, which is located in the
D0$B_PHYSICS:VEES.RCP. The RCP  file is fairly well annotated and should be 
self-explanatory.

    The structure chart is located in D0$B_PHYSICS$VEES:VEES.STR.
The event processing  function VEES checks the value of the RCP parameter
ALL_VEES. If ALL_VEES is true the subroutine VEES_CONE is called for the
full angle covered by the Central Detector.

    VEES_CONE does the Vee reconstruction in a given cone. It can be called 
by the user from her/his analysis program. It gets the information from CD 
track banks ZTRK and VTX, CDC, FDC track banks associated with them. 
The program loops over pairs of tracks and checks if they are consistent with 
coming from a secondary vertex. Track angles are picked up and stored. An 
attempt is made to use the information on the energy deposited in the 
calorimeter cells pointed by the tracks (ZENERGY). The use of the calorimeter 
information is optional, governed by the RCP parameter CALL_ZENERGY.

    A mass constrained fit for the Ks, lambda etc hypothesis is performed by 
the call to subroutine VKIN_FIT. (currently only Ks is fully implemented)
Observed  and fitted  track  parameters are passed among various subroutines 
via array s STR(4,10) which is declared in the common D0$INC:VEEKIN.INC. 
Information  on fitted Vees is stored in the ZEBRA  bank  PVES.  

    A set of histograms is defined in the RCP file. It includes the
number of Vees found, the ditribution of fit probability, Ks momentum.
A comparison of reconstructed Ks momentum and angles with the corresponding
ISAJET data is also done provided one sets the rcp switch MCDATA to true. 
Switches in the RCP  file allow selected histograms to be turned on or off 
and the limits  etc changed without relinking the program.

RUNNING VEES:
----------------

    The following steps are required to run the VEES package:

0) Central tracking and calorimeter reconstruction must already have been done
   by running e.g. the  reconstruction  program  RECO_COMBINED which includes 
   the  packages  ZTRAKS,CALOR,CAHITS.  These can be combined
   with the VEES package into one  overall combined package, but it seems to
   be much more  efficient to have done  the initial  reconstruction once, 
   while simultaneously  producing  an STA  file which can  subsequently be 
   used as input to the dilboson package.

1) Go to your directory where you want to create the VEES package.

            $ SET DEF [XXXX.YYYY]

2) If you want to use the test version of the library do,

            $ LIBTEST ALL

3) Run program builder to create the package in your directory.

            $ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/NAME=VEES

   The above command makes use of a pbd  file called VEES_COMBINED.PBD. This
package  represents a  combined  one which automatically  includes  along with
VEES the two packages CALOR and CAHITS (needed if the calorimeter information
is used in VEES). 

4) Link the program,

            $ @name_D0USER.LNK
   or
            $ @name_D0USER.LNK DEBUG

5) Define input rcp files.

            $ @name_D0USER.COM

   The user may wish  to copy  VEES.RCP and perhaps  VEES.RCP to his/her own
area, and then appropriately edit  name_D0USER.COM to  force the program to take
the rcp files from the user default directory.

6) Run D0USER,

            $D0USER/NOSMG
   or
            $D0USER/FULL
   or
            $DEB_D0USER/NOSMG    

7) Adding user subroutines or modifying existing package subroutines.


            The file specs for these should be inserted into the file

             name_D0USER.OPT
    or
             DEB_name_D0USER.OPT

    and then relink as in step 4.
