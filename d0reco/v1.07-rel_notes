 30-JAN-1991 : Modifications released by Serban D. Protopopescu
 
    - Modified RECONSTRUCT_EVENT.FOR to call WRITE_E_FILE and CLOSE_E_FILE.
      This causes a file to be written out with name E_run#_id#.DAT whenever 
      an event is read in. The file gets deleted if the event was run 
      succesfully.
