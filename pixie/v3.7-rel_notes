 25-SEP-1992 : Modifications made by A. Brandt

    New routines: PSCAN_EXEC.FOR, SCAN_INI.FOR, SCAN_START.FOR, SCAN_SAVE.FOR
                  EZMOVE_ZEBCOM.FOR
    Modified routine   BKPROC.FOR (adds new structural link for SCAN bank
                       + 4 spare links--version 3 of PROC)
    
    With the new Pixie Beta Release, there is a new
    event display menu called SCANNING.  This is an RCP-driven
    scanning sheet.  There are three options under the Scanning menu,
    which can be included in Pixie using SCANDIS.PBD and needs
    the RCP file PX_SCANDIS.RCP.
    
    1)  START SCAN  gets the date and time and checks if the event has
    previously been scanned.  This should be DONE (using PF1)
    at the beginning of the scanning of each  event.  

    2) DO SCAN gives a list of scanning questions stored in 
    PX_SCANDIS.RCP and allows the user to type in answers.
    A standard question list is being formed for systematic
    scanning of events.  The array QUESTION_LIST determines the number of
    questions, with an array of questions and dummy answers following this.
    The number and content of the questions are the only parameters in the
    RCP file that might be changed by the user.  DO SCAN should be done
    after START SCAN  and can be exited and reentered at will.  For example,
    the user may wish to answer a couple questions, go back to the main 
    menu, change views, answer more questions, etc.  The arrow keys are
    used to move from one question to another (or <CR> can be used), the
    down arrow key should be used to access questions that are off the screen
    if there are more than 20 questions.

    3) SAVE SCAN writes the new answers into the RCP bank and
    copies the RCP bank to ZEBCOM (using EZMOVE_ZEBCOM)
    where it hangs under a new 8th structural link of the PROC bank.  
    This should be done at the end of each event that is to be written 
    out.
 
    Note: If the event is  written  out (which can not currently be 
    done in PIXIE framework, but can be in other frames) a subsequent
    scanning of the event will get the answers to any questions that are
    common between the current RCP file and the one previously used.

 25-SEP-1992 : Modifications made by J.B. Singh and N. Oshima

1) Source files

    PIXIE.FOR   - Check for RUN/EVENT number for 'GO TO EVENT' via
                  EVTIN. When it does not find the event, it will skip
                  the event just after read a its header.

    PUINIT.FOR  - Book a flag 'GOTO_EVENT'.

    PUSYSTEM.FOR - Set a flag 'GOTO_EVENT' to .TRUE. when the menu 'GO TO
                   EVENT' was selected.

    PUFINDEVNT.FOR - Find event to be displayed given by the user with
                     a particular RUN and EVENT number.If RUN and/or
                     EVENT number given by the user is LESS THAN 0,
                     it accepts the event.   

    PXEVENT_READ_OK.FOR(New) - Interface routine to PUFINDEVNT.FOR.

    PU_GET_EVNT_NUM.FOR - Reads now RUN and EVENT number to be displayed.  

2) INC file

    PXCOMK.INC  - Added RUNCNT to taking care of RUN number in PUFINDEVNT.

3) PBD files

    ALL_PIXIE_COMBINED.PBD - Added new packages SCANDIS and PIXIE_EVENT.

    PIXIE_EVENT.PBD - New package for the hook READ_EVENT.

    PIXIE_FRAME.PBD - Added READ_EVENT hook.

==================================================================
  2-OCT-1992 : Modifications made by L. Howell

    PUFINDEVNT - The feature of "Get Next Event" was modifyied.  You can search
        a particular event giving the run number and the event number.  This 
        option lets the user enter both the run and event number of the 
        desired event that he/she wants to go to.  If the user do not want to
        specifiy a run number he/she should just hit return at the run number
        prompt.    This option also does not assume that the events nor
        run numbers are in any sequential order.  
        There is a limit in number of events skipped during the search (200),
        when the limit is reached the user will be prompt if he/she wants to
        continue the search.

    PU_GET_EVNT_NUM - Use GETPAR for questions.

    PU_UPDATE_COMMAND_STACK: Check the range of the index used in the
        COMMAND_STACK array, guarding for possible errors.
        ENTRY PX_ZERO_COMMAND_STACK: The variable LAST_MENU is clear at this
        point to indicate the command stack array is being clear.

    PX_SYSTEM.RCP: MAXSEARCH and GET RUN_EVENT added.  
        MAXSEARCH is the limit of number of events scaned when a go to event 
        is called.  Default is 200 after 200 the system prompts a question 
        asking if the user wants to continue the scanning for another 200 
        events.
        GET RUN_EVENT flag that is set the run number and the event number is
        requested when the Go To Event utility is selected.  If it's false
        only the event number will be requested.

    PX_SYSTEM_DOC: Update the documentation to include the new feature of Go To
        Event.

=================================================================
 14-OCT-1992: Modifications made by Robert E. Avery for FDCDIS and ZTRAKSDIS

    - New display created, 'FDC  Road & Sectors'.
        After being shown the full FDC R-Z view of all tracks and roads
        in the event, the user is prompted for a ZTRAKS road.
        Each of the three chamber cells that the road passes through are
        displayed, showing all hits, track segments, full tracks, and
        the ZTRAKS road (as a red dotted line), for comparison.

      The following new routines are associated with this display:
        PF_ROAD_LAYERS.FOR -  Action routine
        PFPICK_ROAD.FOR - Prompts user for road.
        PFTTRK_ROAD.FOR, PFPTRK_ROAD.FOR - drawing routine for road.

      The following files were modified.
        PFEXEC.FOR, PF_THETA_SECT_VIEW.FOR, PF_PHI_SECT_VIEW.FOR
        PF_FDCDIS.RCP, FDCDIS.DOC

    Other changes:
    - PZTHETA_ROAD  Use ZVTX to determine roads, as is now done in FLFSEC.FOR.

    - PFPHI_ROAD  Don't draw full tracking (2*pi) road.

    - PF_3_SECTORS  Draw sector if the track passes through at either
             first or last wire of cell (for theta).

==================================================================
 14-OCT-1992 : Modifications made by L. Howell

    PUMENUDO- In the previous TEST release PUMENUDO was modified so when a
        HARDCOPY command was enterd we DO a reset of the views.  This was done
        to help the hardcopy when superimpose was active.  It turn out that this
        mess up the HARDCOPY of a view that was zoomed.  So I put back the
        condition to exempt the reset of the views if HARDCOPY was called but I
        added to it the condition to reset the views if .NOT. in SUPERIMPOSE
        mode.

    PCSVEN- I tested this routine with a data file that did not have a CAEH bank
        and I found that the EZRSET call to reset PX_CALDIS_RCP set in this
        routine was missed.  So I moved the EZRSET call to the end of the
        routine and put a GOTO 900 to insure it will not be missed.  this was
        probably over looked because we have being using good data files.

==================================================================
 18-OCT-1992 : Modifications made by N. Oshima

    1) Now Trigger/Filter name were picked up from TSUM Bank instead
       of TRIG_FILT_RUN.INFO. PIXIE can show the reliable Trigger/Filter
       name with not only EXAMINE but also other( D0USER, CALOR_OFF and
       PIXIE ) frames.

    PU_GET_TRIG_INFO.FOR - Use TSUM Bank instead of the file TRIG_FILT_RUN
                           to get Trigger/Filter Name.

=================================================================
 21-OCT-1992 : Modifications made by S. Hagopian

               P4LEGO was modified to draw cirles of radius

               LEGEND_DST_LEGO  were modifed to include TAUs.  
               A new routine LEGEND_TAU was written to make a
               label for the taus.
