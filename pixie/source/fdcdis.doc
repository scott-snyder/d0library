                                                            Version 1.0

                         FDCDIS - FDC Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION
      FDCDIS is the FDC event display package.  It is part of the
    PIXIE library, which can be run in various frameworks.
    Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It can display FDC information from all levels of processing:
    raw FADC traces, results of hit finding, track segments made from
    these hits in a given FDC cell, and full tracks for the full FDC.
    The information displayed by FDCDIS comes from the banks created
    by the FDC reconstruction package (FTRAKS, by itself, or as called
    from ZTRAKS). Most displays can be made from the banks that are saved 
    in the standard output stream (STA), although a few of the displays
    require the full output of FTRAKS in order to be useful.
    Only full FDC track information can be displayed from DST files.

II. GETTING an FDC DISPLAY

 A. Program builder

    The package FDCDIS must be included in the package list to get
    the FDC event display. To get combined displays, including all
    calorimeter, tracking and muon displays, just use the package
    ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD 
    for EXAMINE.


 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@FTRAKS_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the FDC display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_FDCDIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_FDCDIS_RCP.
    The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
    The FDCDIS routines also need access to some of the parameters
    used in FDC reconstruction. The required RCP file is
    D0$TRACKING_UTIL:FTRAKS.RCP, and the corresponding logical is
    FTRAKS_RCP. If the user has included the package ALL_DISPLAY,
    these will both be defined by ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.COM, however
    the command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also be executed.
    (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2

       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER.

       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes
       consecutive).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FDC Track & Sectors   - After being shown the full FDC R-Z view of all
        tracks in the event, the user is prompted for a track number. 
        Each of the three chamber cells that the track passes through are 
        displayed, showing all hits, track segments, and full tracks in 
        that FDC sector. 
        (Sector displays are the same as drawn by "FDC Phi Sector" and 
        "FDC Theta Sector", see further description  below)

  FDC Track & FADCs     - Similar to Track & Sectors, but instead of displaying
        the sector displays, the raw FADC trace for each track segment is shown.
        (FADC displays are the same as drawn by "FDC Phi FADC" 
        and "FDC Theta FADC" below)

  FDC Fit Segments      - Allows the user to create his own track using
        up to one segment from each of three layers.
        The resulting track parameters are displayed, and the three FDC 
        sectors that the track passes through are displayed.

  FDC Hits   - Displays all hits and track segments in an FDC half. 
        Each sector (cell) of  each FDC theta quadrant 
        and each FDC Phi sector is displayed on one page. 
        The arrangement of this display does not reflect 
        the true geometry of the FDC! 
        The page is divided into 4 columns, each showing three 
        layers of the FDC in order: 
                1) an inner theta quadrant (INR),
                2) on forth of the Phi sectors (9 cells),
                3) an outer theta quadrant (OUTR).
        If the segment is not on a full track, it is drawn as dotted green line.
        If the segment is on a full track, it is drawn as solid line 
        in forground color.
                                
  FDC Theta Sector      - Displays all of the hits, track segments, and
        full tracks that are found in a single Theta sector (cell). 
        The plot is of drift direction (horizontal) vs Z (vertical).
        Hits put on segments are marked with an X. 
        Hits with an associated delay line are marked with an 0. 
        Segments put on on full tracks are marked with ticks on each end.
        Full tracks are drawn as dotted lines, and extend outside the 
        cell boundary. Ticks on the full tracks indicate segments
        from the other two layers have been placed on the track.

        Below the Sector drawing is an indication of information in
        the delay line direction (perpendicular to drift and beam line). 
        For segments with associated delay lines, the delay line
        position is indicated by a segment label above the line. 
        The track position is indicated by a track label below the line.

  FDC Phi Sector        - Same as "FDC Theta Sector", for a Phi sector.

  FDC Theta FADC        - Displays the FADC traces for all 8 theta sense wires
        and 2 ends of the delay line. Hits that have been found are marked, 
        if not on a segment with a +;  
        if on the n'th  segment, with X,Y,V,A,*,U,T,W, or 0 (in that order).

  FDC Phi FADC          - Displays the FADC traces for all 16 Phi sense wires
                                (same as FDC Theta FADC)

  FDC R-Z View          - Displays all tracks found in the FDC in R-Z view.
        Delay line hits are shown only if they are associated with a segment. 
        If that segment is placed on a track, the hit is marked with a *, 
        otherwise it is marked with a +. 
        Tracks are labeled 0-9, then A-Z, then a-z.
        The top half consists of hits and tracks within the region Y>0. 
        The way that the The top region is chosen can be modified 
        by changing the RCP parameter "FDC PHI MODE" ( The bottom half 
        of the display is always the region diametrically opposite.)
                Mode=0, default, top is y>0.
                Mode=1, Top is region 'PHI CENTER'+- 'PHI WIDTH'
                        given in PX_SYSTEM_RCP. 
                Mode=2, User is prompted for top Phi region.
                Mode=-1, top is X>0 
                        (for test beam, where almost all tracks were in X>0)
        If tracking was done in roads, the theta extent of the roads are drawn.

  FDC R-Phi View        - Displays all tracks found in one FDC half 
        in R-Phi view. If tracks are found only in one half, that half 
        is drawn, else user is prompted for half.
        The outline of all theta quadrants is drawn.
        Hits and tracks are drawn as in the R-Z view.
        If tracking was done in roads, the phi extent of the roads are drawn.
                                
  FDC Combined View     - Displays a combined view of R-Z, and R-Phi for 
        both FDC halves. Hits and tracks are drawn as in the R-Z view,
        but no track labels are drawn.

  FDC Y-Z/X-Z View      - Displays all tracks found in the FDC in the
        Y-Z (top) and X-Z (bottom) view. 
        Hits and tracks are drawn as in the R-Z view.

  FDC Isajet & Sectors - Similar to "FDC Track & Sectors", but based 
        on ISAJET tracks. After being shown the full FDC R-Z view of all
        tracks in the event, the user is prompted for an ISAJET track number. 
        Each of the three chamber cells that the track passes through are 
        displayed, showing all hits, track segments, full tracks, and
        ISAJET tracks in that FDC sector. 

  FDC Road & Sectors - Similar to "FDC Track & Sectors", but based 
        on ZTRAKS roads. After being shown the full FDC R-Z view of all
        tracks in the event, the user is prompted for a ZTRAKS road.
        Each of the three chamber cells that the road passes through are 
        displayed, showing all hits, track segments, full tracks, and
        the ZTRAKS road (as a red dotted line).

  FDC 3D Full           - A 3-D view of Full FDC is shown.
        FDC outline is drawn in Cyan.
        FDC tracks drawn in forground color (unless identified).
        Delay line hits are shown only if they are associated with a segment. 
        FDC hits drawn in forground color if on tracks, else in red.

  FDC one FADC          - Displays FADC trace for a single channel. Also 
        displays first and second differences. Vertical scale is chosen
        by user.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to the above displays, there are a few more special purpose
    displays that are turned off by default. The user can turn these on 
    by editting the PX_FDCDIS.RCP file.

  FDC Track List & Sectors - Same as "FDC Track & Sectors" except that 
        instead of the R-Z view being draw first, a list of all tracks in
        FDC (and associated parameters) is printed.

  FDC Flip Segment      - After the user chooses a segment (by half,
        layer and segment number), the FDC sector display is drawn
        as usual, but in addition the sector is drawn flipped to the
        other side of the sense wire plane, and the Chi-square of the
        segment fit for each side is printed for comparison.

  FDC Theta Boundary    - The FDC sector display for two adjoining
        Theta sector sectors is drawn, particularly useful for looking
        at segments that pass from one sector to another.

  FDC Phi Boundary      - Same as "FDC Theta Boundary", for Phi sectors.

  FDC 3D Segments       - Allows the user to create his own track using
        up to one segment from each of three layers.
        Resulting track is then displayed in 3-D.

  FDC 3D Tracks         - A 3-D view of all tracks in an FDC half is shown.
        User is asked to to choose a view:
                1) Looking above and the side of the FDC.
                2) Looking from the side of the FDC.
                3) Looking along the beam line towards the FDC.
                User is asked for a track number. 
                This effectively just determines the Half.

  FDC 3D 1 Track        - A 3-D view of one track in FDC is shown.
        User is asked to to choose a view:
                1) Looking above and the side of the FDC.
                2) Looking from the side of the FDC.
                3) Looking along the beam line towards the FDC.
                User is asked for a track number. 

  FDC Crate FADC        - Displays the FADC traces for all 16 channels on
        a single FADC card specified by its electronics location 
        (Data cable, Crate, Card).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IV. FDCDIS PARAMETERS in PX_FDCDIS.RCP:
    The above descriptions are the default behavior. The user can modify
    some aspects of the displays by modifying the RCP parameters in 
    the PX_FDCDIS.RCP file, either by directly editting the file before
    running, or interactively, via the menu command, MODIFY.
    There are many (too many) FDCDIS parameters, many of which the user
    should not have to change (some will likely disappear in a future release).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Parameter Name    * Default[Type]  * Remark                                  *

                                 If true, user is prompted for which FDC 
                                 half to draw (unless there are only tracks
                                 in one half, or no tracks at all).
 FDC PHI MODE                0   Determine which region is drawn in top half 
                                   of R-Z views.

                                 Mode=1, Top half is the region:
                                   'PHI CENTER'+- 'PHI WIDTH' in PX_SYSTEM_RCP. 
                                 Mode=2, User is prompted for top Phi region.

                                 If <0 DL included, if >0 DL not included,
                                 =0 default taken from FTRAKS_RCP.
 FDC FIT SEGTRK          FALSE   For "FDC Fit Segments" view, determine
                                 whether fit is done from segments (true)
                                 or from hits (false, default).
 FDC PULSHP               TRUE   For FADC displays - Show pulse shape 
                                 subtraction results if turned on in FTRAKS_RCP.
 FDC PRINT LIST          FALSE   If TRUE, always print list of tracks, 
                                 and segments when choosing, else only once
                                 per event.
