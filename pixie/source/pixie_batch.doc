                        BATCH JOBS USING EVENT DISPLAY


 I. INTRODUCTION 

    This document explains how to submit D0USER as a BATCH job and PIXIE small
    framework to make Event Display hardcopies of selected events.  
    These events can be selected in 3 ways:

    1. A predetermined list of up to 20 event numbers can be used as input in
       the COMPACK input command file.

    2. The PIXIE RCP file for the chosen display package can specify to display
       every event or every nth event on the SEQUENCE card.

    3. The user can set the EVENT_DISPLAY flag in the analysis package for
       events meeting their criteria or cuts.

    The "Sequential Display" mode is used to specify the set of views to be
    displayed (See D0$PIXIE:SEQUENTIAL_DISPLAY.DOC).  D0USER is set into
    processing by means of COMPACK initialization file.   DI3000 is notified
    that there is no CRT only a hardcopy device by the SETDRV command.

II. SET UP THE BATCH JOB

    When PIXIE is submitted as a batch job an input file must be specified so
    its commands will be read into COMPACK.

    A typical command procedure to submit PIXIE as a batch job is:
      $!
      $! Setting hardcopy driver as the primary driver
      $ SETDRV PST PST
      $! Executing PIXIE setup 
      $ @D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM
      $!
      $! Set logical to run exeuctable
      $ BATCH_D0USER:==$D0$D0USER:ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.EXE/COMMAND=SETUP$TEMP.INP
      $!
      $! Running executable
      $ BATCH_D0USER

    Where  SETUP$TEMP.INP is the file that will be use to input the commands for
    COMPACK menu system. 

    The .INP file should reflect the criteria of the user to select the events
    desired to be scan by PIXIE.

    Here is an example of a .INP file:
        Manual Process
        0    !-<Store histograms ? (0,1,2)<cr>:0 >
        n    !-< Will you be reading files from tape? [N]>
        PIXIE$DATAFILE !-< Logical Name of input file >
        N    !-< File mode X,G or N ? [N]:>
        y    !-< Process all events for remaining runs? Y/N >
        Cal  !-< Select Calorimeter submenu
        Start Sequencial Display  !-< Select Sequential Display menu
        1    !-< Pick First sequential display
        BACK !-< Backup out of Calorimeter submenu
        BACK !-< Backup of All display menu
        EXIT !-< Exit D0user


III. SETUP SEQUENTIAL VIEW 

    PIXIE batch runs using sequential display mode.  The user must set up
    his/her own sequential display if there is not one already defined with the
    views he/she will like.  

    For  example,  if  you  will  like  to  submit PIXIE as a batch job and make
    hardcopies  of the "D0 Full Side View" for every event, copy to your
    local area PX_COMBDIS.RCP and add to it a sequential array in that looks 
    like:

        \ARRAY $AUTO_HARDCOPY
        '%TITLE'   'Auto Hardcopy'         ' '
        '%PACKAGE' 'COMBDIS'               ' '
        '%ACTION'  'D0_FULL_SIDE_VIEW%'    ' '
        '%ACTION'  'DELAY 1.0'             ' '
        '%ACTION'  '%SEQUENCE 0 999'        ' '
        \END
   This sequential array will display the "D0 Full Side View" for every event
   making hardcopies of each one.
    

IV. Examples

    EXAMPLE I
    ---------

      (1) Typical COM file to submit D0USER as a batch job to make 
         Event Display hardcopies:

$!========================================================================
$!
$! Name      : BATCH_D0USER
$!
$! Purpose   : Command procedure used when D0USER is submitted as a batch job 
$!             to make Event Display hardcopies.
$!
$! Arguments : None
$!
$! Created  12-FEB-1993   Lupe Howell
$!
$!========================================================================
$   ON ERROR     THEN $ GOTO EXIT
$   ON CONTROL_Y THEN $ GOTO EXIT

$!-----------------------------+
$! Initialize D0USER logicals  |
$!-----------------------------+
$   @D0$D0USER:ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.COM
$!
$!------------------------------------------+
$! Initialize EVENT DISPLAY logicals        |
$!  This takes 3 input parameters:          |
$!   p1 is the type of data(MC,data,cosmic) |
$!   p2 1rst driver in BATCH always PST     |
$!   p3 2nd driver in BATCH always PST      |
$!------------------------------------------+
$   @D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM  MC PST PST
$!
$!-----------------------------+
$!  Define DATAFILE logical    |
$!-----------------------------+
$   DEF PIXIE$DATAFILE FSHES9$DKB200:[D0DATA.D0RECO]SAMUS_58390.STA
$!
$!---------------------------------+
$!  Define local RCP               |
$!  (if you want to use your own)  |
$!---------------------------------+
$   DEF PX_CALDIS_RCP USER1$ROOT1:[LUPE.PIXIE.D0USER]PX_CALDIS.RCP
$!
$!-----------------------------------------------------+
$! Set symbol for executable with correct command file |
$!-----------------------------------------------------+
$ BATCH_D0USER :== $D0$D0USER:ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER /COMMAND=SETUP$TEMP.INP
$!
$!-----------------------+
$! Run executable        |
$!-----------------------+
$ BATCH_D0USER
$!
$EXIT:
$ SET NOVERIFY
$   EXIT

    To submit this file you should use the command:

        $ SUBMIT/QUE=QUE_NAME/NOTIFY/NOLOG BATCH_D0USER.COM

    If you want to make a log file use the parameter /LOG=LOGFILE.LOG

    (2) Command file SETUP$TEMP.INP to run D0USER as a batch
            
Manual Process
0    !-<Store histograms ? (0,1,2)<cr>:0 >
N    !-< Will you be reading files from tape? [N]>
PIXIE$DATAFILE !-< Name of input file >
N    !-< File mode X,G or N ? [N]:>
y    !-< Process all events for remaining runs? Y/N >
Cal
Start Sequencial Display
BACK
BACK
EXIT
       This command file will make hardcopies of the Calorimeter sequential 
       display.  Note that there is only one defined so the particular
       sequential display did not have to be specified.

$ BATCH_PIXIE

$EXIT:
$ SET NOVERIFY
$   EXIT

    (2) Command file SETUP$PIXIE_TEMP.INP to run the small framework of PIXIE
       as a batch

CAL                  !-< Going 
Start Sequential Display !-< Go to COMPACK Sys Menu
Back                 !-< Get out of CAL menu
EXIT                 !-< Get out of PIXIE menu
Quit                 !-< Quit PIXIE

       This command file will make hardcopies of the Calorimeter sequential 
       display.  Note that there is only one sequential display defined in
       this package therefore it does not have to be requested specifically,
       it will start the only one it has automatically.
