                         COMBDIS - Combined Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION

      COMBDIS is the package with the combined views of D0 sub-detectors with 
    events displayed. It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in 
    various frameworks. Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. 
    (See .DOCs) It displays detector outlines, hits, and tracks in cut views,
    where a cross-section of the detector is displayed and hits and tracks 
    from these modules are projected onto this plane. Not all tracks
    and hits are displayed in a cut view. Calorimeter energy is displayed 
    as histograms or towers in these cut views. A 3-D view of cal. cells
    and reconstructed tracks is also available, which can be rotated.


II. GETTING COMBINED DISPLAYS

    These combined displays are built up out of sub-detector dipslays,
    so COMBDIS must be used with the other display packages in ALL_DISPLAY.

 
 A. Use standard LINK file in D0LIBRARY:

    1. $LIBTEST PIXIE,D0USER

    2. $@D0$D0USER:ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK DI3000
        or copy LINK file to your directory and modify it as desired.

    3. $@D0$D0USER:ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER ! to set up needed RCP logicals

    4. $@D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY ! to setup needed STP files and DI3000 drivers
      answer question about whether data is  COSMIC or MC (monte carlo)
      answer question about type of device driver (See D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC)

     5. $RUN ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER


 B. Execute the Program Builder.

    Use the package ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD

    $ PBD/frame=D0USER/package=ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED/name=ALL_DISPLAY-
          /zebcom=1000000/ZEBSTP=600000

   The program builder generates following files.

        ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.COM
        ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.FOR
        ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK
        ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.OBJ
        DEB_ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.OBJ


   Or combined displays can be made in the EXAMINE framework. Use
   D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD (PIXIE is included, so it does not have
   to be chosen as a separate package.)


III. Link: Execute ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK

   Remember to set up the DI3000 logicals before LINKING:

   You can make your EXE file as you like by one of following commands.
    $ @ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK DI3000       - Non debug DI3000 version 
    $ @ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK DI3000 DEBUG - Debug DI3000 version
    $ @ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK EASDI3       - Evans&Sutherland emulator version
    $ @ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK UISDI3       - UIS(DEC VWS) emulator version







 IV. Set up and Execute ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.EXE

   *** The DI3000 logicals should be set up. ***

   The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

    $ DISETSHR EXT HI 

  a) To set up ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER environment and logicals, you need to 
    execute these two COM files.

    $ @ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.COM  - Define logicals and RCP files
    $ @D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY - Define STP files, Input data type and
                                 DI3000 Drivers.
   The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are 
   logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

  b) To execute ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.EXE, just type,
    $ D0USER

   Select the menu "7: Event Displays" from the D0USER SETUP Menu. You
   will receive following questions from this menu.
  
    - How many events to display (<20)? [1] > (RET)

    - Give Run# and Event#.
      If Run#<0, first event read is displayed.

      If Event#<0, first event of Run# is displayed.

      To display consecutive events use the Next Event feature

      in the Event Display menu.

      Run no.> -1 (RET)

      Event no.> -1 (RET)
          


                                                                        Page 3


   You are return to the D0USER SETUP Menu again, select "1: Manual Process"

    - Store histograms ? 0=NO, 1=after each run, 2=end of job only > 0 (RET)

    -  Will you be reading files from tape? [N]> (RET)

      If you give wild card all files with given string are processed

      but option Manual Process will stop after N events requested.

      If name of input file is NONE no file will be open.

    - Name of input file > USR$SCRATCH:[OSHIMA]MY_STA_FILE.GEN (RET)

    - Is input file in exchange mode? [N]:> (RET)

    - Process all events for remaining runs? Y/N > Y (RET)

  D0 Full Side View -  Full side view of D0 detector. Includes the Y-Z cut view
                    of the wide angle muon detector (hits and tracks in muon
                    planes perpindicular to the Y or Z axes). (Note: not all
                    muon tracks and hits are displayed in this view) The Y-Z 
                    small  angle muon chambers, hits and tracks are also shown.
                    R-Z projections of VTX, CDC and FDC hits and tracks
                    with fixed PHI angle cuts of -45. deg to +45. deg
                    (with same+ 2 PI slice plotted below the axes) are shown. 
                    Only hits with Z information appear, when available.
                    The cal. display is in ETA towers, with EM, Fine had. and
                    coarse had. summed separtaely and color coded for energy.
                    Note that since this display includes Y-Z muon tracks and
                    R-Z central tracks and cal., the muon tracks often do not
                    overlap the CD tracks or the hit cal. cells. To see how
                    well the muon and CD tracks match, look at the END VIEW
                    or the 3-D display. This view is meant to give a general 
                    overview.                    
                    
                      
    D0 Full End View - Full end view of D0. This includes the X-Y cut view
                    of the wide angle muon detector (hits and tracks in muon
                    planes perpindicular to the X or Y axes). (Note: not all
                    muon tracks and hits are displayed in this view) The 
                    CDC and VTX X-Y view is displayed with optional sector
                    markings, hits and tracks. The muon tracks should match
                    the CD tracks in this view. A TRD sector plot with 
                    energy histogram is also show as well as a cal. histogram
                    in phi divisions with EM and HAD energy color coded.

  D0 Full Top View -  Full top view of D0 detector. Includes the X-Z cut view
                    of the wide angle muon detector (hits and tracks in muon
                    planes perpindicular to the X or Z axes). (Note: not all
                    muon tracks and hits are displayed in this view) The X -Z 
                    small  angle muon chambers, hits and tracks are also shown.
                    R-Z projections of VTX, CDC and FDC hits and tracks
                    with fixed PHI angle cuts of +45. deg to +135. deg
                    (with same+ 2 PI slice plotted below the axes) are shown.

                    well the muon and CD tracks match, look at the END VIEW
                    or the 3-D display. This view is meant to give a general 
                    overview.                    
                    


    D0 End View -  End view of D0 (muon A layer only) This view is the
                   same as the full end view, but only the muon A-layer
                   chamber and hits area shown. This gives a larger view
                   of the central detector and calorimeter. 


    CAL+TRACKS R-Z View -   This view has the R-Z historgram of CAL energy
                   with electromagnetic and hadronic energy shown separataely.
                   It also has the R-Z projection of tracks and hits in the 
                   CDC, VTX and FDC chambers. This view can be sliced with
                   a PHI cut by using "PICK" in the CAL part of the END VIEW
                   to choose a central PHI value. The width of the PHI slice
                   is set by CAL DPHI (default=3 secotrs, approx. width of 
                   a JET.) 
    

    CAL+TRACKS End View - End view of the central detector. This is the X-Y 
                  (R-PHI) view of the CDC and VTX chambers with the TRD sector
                  energy histogram. The PHI histogram of CAL energy or Et is
                  also displayed with electromagnetic and hadronic energy 
                  shown separataely.


    END CAP South - This is an X-Y view of the south end cap. It includes
                    the FDC south, the R-PHI Et or E histogram for the
                    south calorimeter end cap (determined by parameter 
                    'CAL ETORE'), and muon tracks which are within 45 deg of 
                    the +Z axis. 

    END CAP North - This is an X-Y view of the north end cap. It includes
                    the FDC north, the R-PHI Et or E histogram for the
                    north calorimeter end cap (determined by parameter 
                    'CAL ETORE'), and muon tracks which are within 45 deg of 
                    the -Z axis. 

    TRACKS R-Z View -   This view has the R-Z projection of tracks and hits 
                     in the CDC, VTX and FDC chambers.

    TRACKS End View - End view of the central detector. This is the X-Y 
                   (R-PHI) view of the CDC and VTX chambers with the TRD sector
                   energy histogram. 

    D0 Full 3D View -  3D view of D0 with tracks. This include cal. cells 
                     with energy above EMIN, color coded, muon tracks and
                     hits, and ZTRAKS ( Cen. detector tracks reconstructed
                     in 3-dimensions.) This view can be rotated on VAXSTATIONS
                     or the Evans and Sutherland, using the ROTATE command.



 VI. COMBDIS VIEWS in PX_COMBDIS.RCP:

     The COMBINED VIEWS are multiviews (indicated by a % after the command)
     The parameters for COMBDIS are used to override the sub-detector display
     parameters (so all diplays are in same coordinate system, etc.)
     Below is D0 FULL END VIEW, as an example of a multiview command.
