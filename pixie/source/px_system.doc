             PIXIE SYSTEM MENU AND PARAMETERS
 


 I. PIXIE SYSTEM MENU


          The PIXIE SYSTEM appends 14 menu items to the bottom of the
  DISPLAY package application menu items. The SYSTEM menu items are
  of a general nature and are useful for many different packages.
  An example of a COMPACK menu with 7 application items would become:

   1: Application item 1                  2: Application item 2
   3: Application item 3                  4: Application item 4
   5: Application item 5                  6: Application item 6
   7: Application item 7                  8: NEXT Event
   9: GO TO Event                        10: ZOOM
  11: ROTATE                             12: PICK 
  13: HARDCOPY                           14: MODIFY 
  15: Change Display Mode                16: Superimpose(On/Off)
  17: Set Path                           18: Dump Event
  19: Write Event                        20: Start Sequence Display 
  21: COMPACK System Menu


    SYSTEM Menu Set:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Menu Title            * Function & Remark                                    *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NEXT Event             - Go to next event. If the display is in automatic 
                         display mode then the same view will be displayed
                         after the next event has been read in.

 ZOOM                   - Apply a zoom to the current display. The area to be
                         zoomed is defined by supplying two points with the 
                         mouse.

 ROTATE                 - Apply a rotation to the current display, if screen
                         parameter VIEW3D was set to True.
                         To activate the rotation the user must select with 
                         the mouse the display to rotate first.  A rotational   
                         cylinder will be drawn around the display selected.   
                         This cylinder helps the user to select the direction 
                         in which he/she desires to rotate the object, by 
                         clicking with the mouse on the part of the cylinder you
                         wish to rotate.  The object is redrawn in the new view.
                         The rotation can continue by using the same steps 
                         again.    To stop the rotation mode the user must 
                         click on the run event label in the graphics window.

 PICK                   - Pick a point in the current display, and if screen
                         parameter PICKABLE was set to True, execute a PICK 
                         action associated with the display.

 HARDCOPY               - Produce a hardcopy of the current display.
                          If a printer queue logical cod$PRINT has been
                          defined in D0$DISK:[D0LIBRARY]D0LOCAL.COM or
                          by the user, where cod is the 3 character 
                          DI3000 code for the printer device driver,
                          then the hardcopy is automatically
                          printed on that queue and the file is deleted.
                          Otherwise, a file, (one per HARDCOPY command)
                          is kept in the default area. It usually has a 
                          name made from the DI3000 driver name +.DAT.
                          If you do not want the file to be automatically
                          printed, then just do:
                          $DEFINE cod$PRINT DUMMY
                          A logical cod$FORM should also be defined, if
                          a spcial graphics form is needed for the printer.

                          If you are using the PST (postscript) driver PIXIE
                          will assume the name used for the hardcopy file is
                          POSTS.DAT.  If PIXIE finds such file in the current
                          directory it will rename the file using the run 
                          number, event number and the name of the view.
                          For example: PIX_123_456_ENDVIEWCALORIMETER.DAT
                          where 123 is the run number, 456 is the event number
                          and ENDVIEW CALORIMETER is the name of the view that
                          the hardcopy was done on.  
                          
   *If you want to make a hardcopy using the grey scale in a postscript 
    driver set the parameter DEFTERM in PX_SYSTEM_RCP to 4.

 MODIFY                 - Modify any parameters which are in PX_xxxxxx.RCP
                         file. A sub menu is shown offering a list of 
                         parameters to modify.


 GO TO Event            - Go to a particular event number. If the display
                         is in automatic display mode then the same view will
                         be displayed after the correct event has been read in.
                         You can search a particular event giving the run 
                         number and the event number.  This option lets the user
                         enter both the run number and the event number of the
                         desired event that he/she wants to go.   If the user 
                         do not want to specifiy a run number he/she should 
                         just hit return at the run number prompt.   This 
                         option does NOT assume that the events nor run numbers 
                         are in any sequential order.  
                         There is a limit in number of events skipped during 
                         the search, this is store in the system parameter
                         'MAXSEARCH' and its default value is 200, when the 
                         limit is reached the user will be prompt too see 
                         if he/she wants to continue the search.


 Change Display Mode    - Toggle between Automatic display of the same display
                         and Manual selection of a display when NEXT EVENT or
                         GO TO EVENT is selected.

 Superimpose(On/Off)    - Toggle between Superimposing and NOT superimposing
                         subsequent views.

 Set Path               - Set the ZEBRA data path in /ZEBCOM/.

 Dump Event             - Set the flag DUMP_THIS_EVENT to TRUE. The action 
                         performed is framework-dependent.

 Write Event            - Set the flag WRITE_THIS_EVENT to TRUE. The action
                         performed is framework-dependent.

 Start Sequence Display - The display of a set of views defined in an RCP 
                         array.   The views will be displayed together with
                         a delay interval between each view skipping a
                         number of events between the whole sequence display.  
                         This sequence display is repeated either a specified 
                         number of times or indefinitely.  This sequence can be 
                         interrupted at any given time by the user by executing 
                         the 'Stop Sequence Display' option that will be 
                         displayed during the sequence. The delay interval, 
                         the number of event to skip and the number of times 
                         the display is repeated are paramters specified in 
                         the array. See D0$PIXIE:SEQUENCE_DISPLAY.DOC for
                         examples and further information.

 II. PIXIE SYSTEM PARAMETERS

     A. COMPACK parameters
        The PIXIE system parameters set the default size for the  COMPACK menu

               DEFCOL 2        !Default number of columns
               DEFSPA 1        !Default spacing in menu

     B. PIXIE SYSTEM INTERACTIVE PARAMETERS

   The PIXIE system sets some global parameters defaults that are used 
   by many of the PIXIE display packages. The PHI parameters are used in the 
   selection of the PHI region to be displayed in the R-Z plots. These 
   parameters can be changes by the MODIFY PARAMETER command or by user
   dialog inside the various packages.

!---------------------------------------------------------
* Parameter Name    * Default[Type]  * Remark                                  *

  'BEAM X-ING NUM'    .TRUE.   ' T:plot the beam crossing number, F:does not'
  'PHI TYPE'          .TRUE.   ' T:global(pick PHI from this RCP), F:local'
  'PHI CONTROL'       .TRUE.   ' T:reset to the default PHIs, F:previous PHIs'
  'PHI CENTER'        87.1875  ' a center of Phi slice in deg.( 0=<180 )'
  'PHI WIDTH'         87.1875  ' a half width of Phi slice in degree'
  'PHI DEF CEN'       87.1875  ' a default PHI center to be reset'
  'PHI DEF WID'       87.1875  ' a default PHI width to be reset'
  'DEFTERM'            1       'Default terminal,1-default,2-B/W,3-color'
  'MAXSEARCH'         200      'Number of events to skip in goto search'


DEFTEM - This parameters tells PIXIE what type of device is being used, 
         (Color or B/W).
         To determine the type of device we can only use the total number of
         color given by the DI3000 routine JIQDEV.  This routine will return
         the number of colors in the device in the following matter:
            Color DEC VAX Station..........................10 to 254*
            Monochrome DEC Vax Stations....................1 to 2**
            Intensity DEC Vax Stations.....................10 to 254*
         * This value depends on the number of bit maps in the station.
           If a 4 bit color map monitor it will be 10
           if a 8 bit color map it will be 254
         **If using GPV driver it will be 1 if using XDW driver is 2

        As you can see there is an ambiguity between Color and Intensity 
        Stations.  This is where DEFTERM comes in handy.

DEFTERM = 1, PIXIE will determine the type of device using the number of
          colors given by the DI3000 routine JIQDEV.
          If DEVCOL >= 10 it assumes Color Vax Station
             DEVCOL <= 10 it assumes Monochrome DEC Vax Station 
          This was how PIXIE was working before DEFTERM added.

DEFTERM = 2 forces the assumtion that the terminal is Black/White
          This option should be use when an Intensity Vax Station is used, 
          i.e. the number of colors (DEVCOL) is 10 to 254 but they represent
          grey shades.

DEFTERM= 4, This option is use to make a hardcopy using a grey scale in a
         postscript printer.   The file created is assume to be printed in a
         black and white printer, it will give the wrong colors if it is printer
         in a color printer.

MAXSEARCH = Limit of events scan for each search during the 'Go to Event' 
          system utility. The system will search for the requested event and 
          run number up to the given limit (MAXSEARCH) after the limit is 
          reached the user will be prompt to see if he/she wants to continue 
          the search.
