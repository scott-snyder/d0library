I. SEQUENCE DISPLAY 

   A "Sequence Display" is the display of a set of views displayed together 
   with a delay interval between each view.  The display of these set of views
   is defined in an RCP array.   The views will be displayed together with a 
   delay interval between each view skipping a number of events between the 
   whole sequence display. 

   The sequence display is repeated either a specified number of times or 
   infinitely.   This sequence can be interrupted at any given time by the 
   user by executing the "Stop Sequence Display" option that will be displayed 
   during the sequence. The delay interval, the number of event to skip and 
   the number of times the display is repeated are paramters specified in 
   the array.

  The display will be done skipping a requested amount of events in between 
  each "Sequence Display", this is determine by the first input in the 
  '%SEQUENCE ..'  line.  When the sequence display is executed it will show 
  first the views in the sequence display before any events are skipped and 
  then it will start skipping events and displaying views.  The number of 
  times this sequence display is repeated will depend on the second input in 
  the '%SEQUENCE INPUT1 INPUT2' line.


II. SETUP THE SEQUENCE DISPLAY ARRAY
    
   The Sequence Display RCP array should follow certain guidelines:

    1) The name of the sequence display array has to start with a '$'
    2) The sequence display array should have a '%TITLE' as first item.
    2) The sequence display array should define every view it contains by the
       following:
        '%PACKAGE'   'CALDIS'               ' '
        '%ACTION'    'END VIEW CALORIMETER' ' '
        '%ACTION'    'DELAY 1.0'            ' ' ! Dealy of view 1
        '%PACKAGE'   'CALDIS'               ' '
        '%ACTION'    'ETA HISTO CALORIMETER' ' '
        '%ACTION'    'DELAY 1.0'            ' ' ! Dealy of view 2
        :              :                    :
   3)At the end of all the views in the sequence display array an aditional 
     '%ACTION' should be place defining the number of events to skip and the 
     number of times the sequence display should be done:
      \ARRAY $TEST_SEQUENCE
           :            :                     :
         '%ACTION'     '%SEQUENCE  2 3'          ' '
       \END
      where,
        2 : Is the number of events that are goint to be skipped between
            sequence displays, and 
        3 : is the number of times the sequence display will be executed.
 

   If the first number in the '%SEQUENCE' is left out or set to zero it will
   not skip any events, it will display the events sequentially.

   If the second number is left out or set to zero the  default value is
   9999999, i.e., it will run until the interrupt botton is use or until it run
   out of events.


  During the execution of sequence display an interrupt menu item will be
  displayed in the menu system allowing the user to interrupt the sequence
  display at any time, returning to the regular menu system afterwords.

   
III SEQUENCE EVENT ARRAY

    \ARRAY $D0_SEQUENCE
    '%TITLE'       'TRIG Display'     'Title of sequence'
    
    '%PACKAGE'     'CALDIS'           'Package of 1st display in sequence' 
    '%ACTION'      'END_SIDE_CAL%'    'First display of sequence' 
    '%ACTION'      'DELAY  5.0'       'Delay of 1st display'
    '%PACKAGE'     'CALDIS'           'Package of 1st display in sequence' 
    '%ACTION'      '3D CAL CELLS'     'Second display of sequence' 
    '%ACTION'      'DELAY  5.0'       'Delay of 2nd display'
    '%ACTION'      '%SEQUENCE 0  999' 'Skip events sequentially, repeate seq 999
                                       times'
    \END
