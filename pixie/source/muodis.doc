                         MUODIS - Muon Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION

      MUODIS is the D0 Wide Angle Muon system (WAMUS) event display. 
    It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in various
    frameworks. Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It displays module outlines, hits, cells, and tracks. There are
    two main types of displays - "views" where the viewer is at a distance
    outside the whole muon detector, and only modules that have hits
    are displayed, and "cuts", where a cross-section of the detector is 
    displayed and hits and tracks from these modules are projected onto 
    this plane. Not all tracks and hits are displayed in a cut view.
    There is also a "TRACK BLOWUP", which is centered around a track, 
    with 2 views, bend plane and non-bend plane.

II. GETTING a MUON DISPLAY

 A. Program builder 

    The package MUODIS must be included in the package list
    to get the MUON event display. To get combined displays, including CAL and
    ZTRAKS as well as WAMUS and SAMUS,  use the package ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.
    (The % indicates it is a combined package).


 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@MUONS_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals 

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI 

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are 
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the WAMUS display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_MUODIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_MUODIS_RCP.
    The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
    It also needs STP files to define the geometry. Logicals pointing
    to the default files are defined in the program builder file,
    MUONS_USER.COM. If the user has included the package ALL_DISPLAY,
    the command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also be executed.
    (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2
 
       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER. 
   
       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes 
       consecutive).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ALL VIEWS  -      shows all modules which have at least one hit
                      and all tracks (with each line given a track number).
                      A 0 is placed at the point (0,0,0) to guide the eye. 
                      The Y-Z view, X-Y view and X-Z view are show separately.

    TK Blowup -       Blow-up around a particular track by invoking the 
                      TRACK view and answering the questions.
                      Details of the implementation will change with time.

    Y-Z View -        shows all modules which have at least one hit
                      and all tracks (with each line given a track number).
                      The view point is on the X-Axis, outside the detector.

    X-Y View -        shows all modules which have at least one hit
                      and all tracks (with each line given a track number).
                      The view point is on the Z-Axis, outside the detector.

    X-Z View -        shows all modules which have at least one hit
                      and all tracks (with each line given a track number).
                      The view point is on the Y-Axis, outside the detector.
    YZ cut -          Cross-section of WAMUS in Y-Z plane at X=0. 
                      (WAMUS SIDE VIEW). Hits and tracks that go thru
                      these modules (and ones parallel to them) are projected
                      onto this plane. (Not all hits and tracks are displayed)

    XY cut -          Cross-section of WAMUS in X-Y plane at Z=0. 
                      (WAMUS END VIEW). Hits and tracks that go thru
                      these modules (and ones parallel to them) are projected
                      onto this plane. (Not all hits and tracks are displayed)

    XZ cut -          Cross-section of WAMUS in X-Z plane at Y=0. 
                      (WAMUS TOP VIEW). Hits and tracks that go thru
                      these modules (and ones parallel to them) are projected
                      onto this plane. (Not all hits and tracks are displayed)
                   
    R-Z view -        Muon tracks are projected onto the R-Z plane.
                      Tracks with 180.GE.phi.GE.0 are projected to +R
                      Tracks with 360.GE.phi.GE.180 are projected to -R

    MUON DUMP -       Gives choices to dump MUD1 (raw muon hit bank),
                      MUOT (muon track bank) or MUPRT (dump both).
                      If CALL EVE is selected, the dump is shown
                      in the EVE editor. Otherwise a file called
                      MUO_nnnnnnnn_mmmmmmmm.DMP is created (nnnnnnnn is
                      the run number and mmmmmmmm is the event number of
                      the event being dumped). The file contains the EVENT
                      header printout and the reqeusted bank printout.
