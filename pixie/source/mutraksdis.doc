                         MUTRAKSDIS - MUON System Track Display

 I. INTRODUCTION
      MUTRAKSDIS is the combined MUON system event display package.
    It makes displays that combine hits, tracks and detector modules
    from the Wide Angle Muon System (WAMUS) and the Small Angle Muon 
    System (SAMUS). More detailed views can be found in the individual 
    detector packages (MUODIS and SAMDIS). It is part of the PIXIE library, 
    which can be run in various frameworks. Hooks are set up for PIXIE 
    in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)


II. GETTING a MUTRAKS DISPLAY

 A. Program builder

    The package MUTRAKSDIS must be included in the package list to get
    the MUTRAKS event display. Since MUTRAKSDIS makes combined displays using
    displays from MUODIS and SAMDIS, these should also be included.
    If the user wants displays during reconstruction, they should use
    MUON_ONLINE in EXAMINE, and MUONLY in D0USER.
    To get combined displays, including CAL and all tracking and muon
    displays, just use the package ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER 
    or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for EXAMINE. 
    
 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@MUONLY_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the MUTRAKS display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_MUTRAKSDIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_MUTRAKSDIS_RCP. The user may redirect
    the RCP logicals to their own files. 
        All the required RCP files are defined automatically by the
    'combined_package'_D0USER.COM if the MUTRAKS or ALL_DISPLAY packages have
    been included. The command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also
    be executed. (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2

       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER.

       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes
       consecutive).

  MUTRAKS SIDE VIEW - Side view of SAMUS system, and hit WAMUS modules. Tracks
                      are color codes for SAMUS only, WAMUS only or combined
                      SAMUS+WAMUS tracks.

  MUTRAKS TOP VIEW - TOP view of SAMUS system and hit WAMUS modules. Tracks
                      are color codes for SAMUS only, WAMUS only or combined
                      SAMUS+WAMUS tracks.


 IV. MUTRAKSDIS PARAMETERS in PX_MUTRAKSDIS.RCP:
    The above descriptions are the default behavior. The user can modify
    some aspects of the displays by modifying the RCP parameters in
    the PX_MUTRAKSDIS.RCP file, either by directly editting the file before
    running, or interactively, via the menu command, MODIFY.
    Many aspects of the displays can be modified by changing parameters 
    of the individual detector displays (MUODIS or SAMDIS).


V. MUTRAKSDIS SCREENS in PX_MUTRAKSDIS.RCP:

     The MUTRAKS COMBINED VIEWS are all multiviews.  The parameters 
     for MUTRAKSDIS are used to override the sub-detector display parameters
     (so all displays are in same coordinate system, etc.).
     Below is MUTRAKS_SIDE_VIEW, as an example of a multiview command.
