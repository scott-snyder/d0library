                         ZTRAKSDIS - CD Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION
      ZTRAKSDIS is the Central Detector event display package.
    It makes displays that combine the various central detector views.
    It is intended to provide all of the displays needed to get a
    general idea of the central detector's performance, displaying
    hits, tracks in individual detectors, and combined CD tracks.
    The CD can be viewed in the R-Z view, in the R-Phi view and in a 3-D view.
    More detailed views can be found in the individual detector packages 
    (FDCDIS,CDCDIS,VTXDIS and TRDDIS).
    It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in various frameworks.
    Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)


II. GETTING a CD DISPLAY

 A. Program builder

    The package ZTRAKSDIS must be included in the package list to get
    the CD event display. Since ZTRAKSDIS makes combined displays using
    displays from VTXDIS,TRDDIS,CDCDIS, and FDCDIS, these should also
    be included. To get these combined displays for the Central Detector
    just use the combined package CDDIS_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or
    CD_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for EXAMINE2. To get combined displays, 
    including CAL and all tracking and muon displays, just use the package 
    ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for 
    EXAMINE. 

 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@ZTRAKS_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the ZTRAKS display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_ZTRAKSDIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_ZTRAKSDIS_RCP. The user may redirect
    the RCP logicals to their own files. The ZTRAKSDIS routines also
    need access to some of the parameters used in Central Tracking
    reconstruction, for example D0$TRACKING_UTIL:ZTRAKS.RCP.
        All the required RCP files are defined automatically by the
    'combined_package'_D0USER.COM if the ZTRAKS or ALL_DISPLAY packages have
    been included. The command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also
    be executed. (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2

       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER.

       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes
       consecutive).

  CEN Detect R-PHI      - This is a combined view of the VTX, CDC and TRD
                                chambers as seen in the R-Phi projection.
                                For the CDC and VTX, all hits are shown.
                                For the TRD, an energy histogram plot is shown.
                                Tracks in individual detectors are
                                color coded according to particle type,
                                if that information exists:
                                 * Green - track is in a muon road.
                                 * Red - track is in an electron road.
                                 * Blue - track is in a tau road.
                                 * Yellow - track contributed to a Vee.
                                In addition, combined CD fitted tracks are
                                shown as Forground dashed lines.
                                If tracking was done in roads, the phi
                                extent of the roads are drawn.

  VTX+CDC+FDC R-PHI View - This is a combined view of the VTX, CDC and FDC
                                chambers as seen in the R-Phi projection.
                                For the CDC and VTX, all hits are shown.
                                For the FDC, delay line hits are shown only
                                if they are associated with a track segment.
                                Track are drawn as in "CEN Detect R-PHI".
                                If tracking was done in roads, the phi
                                extent of the roads are drawn.

  VTX+CDC+FDC R-Z View  - This is a combined view of the VTX, CDC and FDC
                                tracking chambers as seen in an R-Z projection.
                                The top half consists of hits and tracks
                                within the region 'PHI CENTER'+- 'PHI WIDTH'
                                given in PX_SYSTEM_RCP. The default is for
                                this to be the top half (y>0). The bottom half
                                of the display is always the region
                                diametrically opposite. For the CDC and VTX,
                                all hits with Z information are shown.
                                For the FDC, delay line hits are shown only
                                if they are associated with a track segment.
                                Track are drawn as in "CEN Detect R-PHI".
                                If tracking was done in roads, the theta
                                extent of the roads are drawn.

  Combined 3-D Tracks   - 3D view of Central Detector tracks reconstructed
                          in 3-dimensions. This view can be rotated on 
                          VAXSTATIONS or the Evans and Sutherland, using 
                          the ROTATE command.
                          All hits, which have 3D information can also be 
                          drawn. The hits display is controled by the 
                          parameter "ZTRAKS DRAW HITS". In the central region,
                          draw_hits=1 all hits are same color
                          draw_hits=2 mark hit on track
                          draw_hits=3 mark mirror hits (+phi purple;
                                                        -phi green)
                          Draw the sectors and wires are available in the
                          3D view display too.

  FDC Combined View     - Displays a combined view of R-Z, and R-Phi for
                                both FDC halves.

  FDC Hits              - Displays all hits and track segments in an FDC half. 
                        Each sector (cell) of  each FDC theta quadrant 
                        and each FDC Phi sector is displayed on one page. 
                        The arrangement of this display does not reflect 
                        the true geometry of the FDC! 
                        The page is divided into 4 columns, each showing three 
                        layers of the FDC in order: 
                                1) an inner theta quadrant (INR),
                                2) on forth of the Phi sectors (9 cells),
                                3) an outer theta quadrant (OUTR).
                        If the segment is not on a full track, it is 
                        drawn as dotted green line.
                        If the segment is on a full track, it is 
                        drawn as solid line in forground color.

  ZTRAKS Top View - R-Z projections of VTX, CDC and FDC hits and tracks
                    with fixed PHI angle cuts of -45. deg to +45. deg
                    (with same+ 2 PI slice plotted below the axes). 



  ZTRAKS Side View - R-Z projections of VTX, CDC and FDC hits and tracks
                    with fixed PHI angle cuts of +45. deg to +135. deg
                    (with same+ 2 PI slice plotted below the axes). 

 IV. ZTRAKSDIS PARAMETERS in PX_ZTRAKSDIS.RCP:
    The above descriptions are the default behavior. The user can modify
    some aspects of the displays by modifying the RCP parameters in
    the PX_ZTRAKSDIS.RCP file, either by directly editting the file before
    running, or interactively, via the menu command, MODIFY.
    There are only a few ZTRAKSDIS specific parameters.
    Many aspects of the displays can be modified by changing parameters 
    of the individual detector displays (CDCDIS, etc.).

V. ZTRAKSDIS SCREENS in PX_ZTRAKSDIS.RCP:

     The ZTRAKS COMBINED VIEWS are mostly all multiviews.  The parameters 
     for ZTRAKSDIS are used to override the sub-detector display parameters
     (so all displays are in same coordinate system, etc.).
     Below is VTX+CDC+FDC R-PHI View, as an example of a multiview command.
