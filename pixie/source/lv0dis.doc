                         LV0DIS - Level 0 Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION
      LV0DIS is the Level 0 event display package.  It is part of the
    PIXIE library, which can be run in various frameworks.
    Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It can display LV0 information from all levels of processing:
    raw ADC values from the TRGR Zebra bank to results of hit processing
    stored in the PLV0 Zebra bank.  The information displayed by LV0DIS
    comes from the banks created by the LV0 reconstruction package LEVEL0.
    Most displays can be made from the PLV0 bank saved in the DST output
    files, although a few of the displays require the presence of the
    TRGR bank (STA or RAW files) in order to be maximally useful.

II. GETTING an LV0 DISPLAY

 A. Program builder

    The package LV0DIS must be included in the package list to get
    the LV0 event display.  It is recommended that the LEVEL0 package
    be included BEFORE the LV0DIS package when processing RAW data files.
    To get combined displays, including all calorimeter, tracking and
    muon displays, just use the package ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for
    D0USER or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for EXAMINE.


 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@yourname_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the LV0 display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_LV0DIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_LV0DIS_RCP.
    The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
    The LV0DIS routines also need access to some of the parameters
    used in LV0 reconstruction. The required RCP file is
    D0$LEVEL0:LEVEL0.RCP, and the corresponding logical is
    LEVEL0_RCP. If the user has included the package ALL_DISPLAY,
    these will both be defined by ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.COM, however
    the command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also be executed.
    (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2

       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER.

       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes
       consecutive).

* LV0DIS Menu Title    * Function & Remark                                    *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  LV0 Pads Hit N  - Displays the North Level 0 scintillator array with
        the scintillator pads that were hit shaded proportionally to the
        amount of charge collected from the associated PMT signal.
        Any pad hit also has its electronics readout channel number written
        in the center of the pad.  Small numbers in a particular
        pad cell show the number of Forward Drift Chamber reconstructed tracks
        passing through that pad and the '+' markers show the projected position
        of the track.

  LV0 Pads Hit S  - similar to the 'LV0 Pads Hit N' display except the South
        Level 0 scintillator array is shown.

  LV0 R-Z - displays an R-Z view of the Level 0 scintillator pads that have hits
        in them along with markers for projected FDC tracks.  The short
        counters are displayed in the two inner layers.  The horizontal long
        counters are displayed in the innermost layer and the vertical long
        counters are displayed in the outermost layer.  Short counters
        centered at y=0 are shown in the outermost layer.  In addition, the
        FASTZ z position is marked with an 'F' along the beampipe.  The Slow
        Z position is marked with an 'Sn' where n=1,2,3,or 4, the multiple
        interaction flag value.  If turned on, an extra Slow Z value is
        available which uses software results with additional cuts.  It is
        displayed as 'Tn'.

  Combo LV0 View - is a combined view of the LV0 Pads Hit N & S and the R-Z
        view.

  Duel LV0 View - is similar to the R-Z view but are correctly projected
        X-Z and Y-Z views.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to the above displays, there are a few more special purpose
    displays that are turned off by default. The user can turn these on
    by editting the PX_LV0DIS.RCP file.

  LV0 X-Z View  - is the X-Z projection similar to the R-Z view.

  LV0 Y-Z View  - is the Y-Z projection similar to the R-Z view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IV. LV0DIS PARAMETERS in PX_LV0DIS.RCP:
    The above descriptions are the default behavior. The user can modify
    some aspects of the displays by modifying the RCP parameters in
    the PX_LV0DIS.RCP file, either by directly editting the file before
    running, or interactively, via the menu command, MODIFY.
    There are many (too many) LV0DIS parameters, many of which the user
    should not have to change (some will likely disappear in a future release).

                                 Mode=2, User is prompted for top Phi region.
                                 Mode=-1, Top is X>0 (default for Test Beam).
 LV0 PRINT LIST          FALSE   If TRUE, always print list of tracks,
                                 and segments when choosing, else only once
                                 per event.
