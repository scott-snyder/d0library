                         TRDDIS - TRD Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION

      TRDDIS is the package for D0 Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) event 
    display. It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in various 
    frameworks. Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It can be combined with other detector's event display too.
    It displays the ADC counts or energy in each radial sector and
    FADC traces. There are choices to make the display flexible.


II. GETTING a TRD DISPLAY

  A. Program Builder 

    The package TRDDIS must be included in the package list to get the TRD 
    event display. To get combined displays for the Central Detector's all 
    subdetectors, just use the package CDDIS_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or
    CD_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for EXAMINE2. To get combined displays, 
    including CAL, MUON and all CD subdetectors just use the package 
    ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for 
    EXAMINE. 

    The TRD event  display has  the capability  to display raw  hits on RAW data
    files and DST files or  hits on interesting tracks  such as electrons on  
    STA or DST files.   To do TRD  reconstruction  and make TRD  event display 
    in the same program, the  package TRDDIS should be  combined with  ZTRAKS 
    at least (and also possibly several calorimeter packages).
    
    For example to make a D0USER which can do TRD reconstruction of all the
    tracks in an event (e.g. a minimum bias event) and TRD display at the same
    time, one should run PBD as:
    $ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACKAGE=(ZTRAKS,TRDDIS)/NAME=xxxx
    and set the ZTRAKS.RCP parameter CALL_TRD to .TRUE. at run time.

  B. Link

    Once the package TRDDIS is included in your PBD command, the DI3000
    have to be include in the link command for D0USER (but not for EXAMINE2).
    For example,
    $ @xxxx_D0USER.LNK DI3000
    
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to pick up the 
    latest event display routines and parameters.


  C. Setup for Run

   1. DI3000 Logicals 
      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do

      $SETUP DI3000 

      or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node and execute DILOGIN.COM.
      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI 

      $ SETDRV driv1 driv2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

      The first driver driv1 should correspond to the type of terminal you are 
      logged on to; the second one driv2 to a hardcopy device [e.g. LN3].

      For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

   2. PIXIE Logicals. 
      The event display needs a RCP file to define the views to be 
      displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
      For the TRD display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_TRDDIS.RCP.
      The corresponding logical is PX_TRDDIS_RCP.
      The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
      The logicals pointing to the default files are defined in the 
      program builder file, xxxx_D0USER.COM.  Execute:

      $ @xxxx_D0USER

      to get all RCP logicals defined.

   3. STP File Logical
      The TRD display also needs STP file to define the geometry. 
      To pick up the right file, you need to execute the following command file:

      $ @D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY
      (This procedure setup STP file and does $SETDRV)
      
      You are prompted to choose between three different STP files: data, COSMIC
      or MC. For the TRD, these are actually the same file, so you just have to
      enter CR.

  D. Running

   1. Running EXAMINE2
      After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
      "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

   2. Running D0USER. 
      There are two ways to use event display. The first is to turn on 
      the interactive menu and then, while analyzing events, do a 
      DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
      One can also turn on the automatic event display by select the item
      EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before entering the input data file. It will ask 
      how many events and their particular IDs (answer -1, if you want to
      start the event display from the first event).


III. TRDDIS MENU

SUB_LEVEL: TRD EVENT DISPLAY    SETUP
Select: {command, #, HELP (#), MENU, BACK} >menu

   1: TRD TK R-PHI                        2: TRD HITS Display
   3: Select Wire TK R-PHI                4: Select Wire Hits

Note: There is an additionnal item which can be obtained by a switch in the
PX_TRDDIS.RCP and doesn't appear on this menu: TRD 3D geometry. Up to
now (2/93), this is nothing more than a drawing a view of the TRD in 
perspective. 

  For further information on menu items 5 - 21, see D0$PIXIE:PX_SYSTEM.DOC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*TRDDIS Menu Title    * Function & Remark                                    *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1: TRD_TK_R-PHI - Displays the energy for TRD Tracks per sector in the
                     R-PHI view.

   2: TRD_HITS_DISPLAY - Display of the raw ADC counts/sector in the R-PHI view.

   3: SELECT WIRE TK R-PHI - This command gives a sub-menu with two items:

      3.1: FADC DISPLAY OF A WIRE - When this is selected, the TK_R-PHI DISPLAY
                                is redrawn, and the user should click with the
                                mouse on the wire for with the FADC trace is
                                desired. Then the program draws three FADC
                                traces, one for each layer and labels them with
                                wire number and layer number.

      3.2: ENERGY AND WIRE -- When this is selected, the TK_R-PHI DISPLAY
                                is redrawn, and the user should click with the
                                mouse on the wire of interest. The program
                                displays its energy and wire number.

   4: SELECT WIRE HITS - This command gives a sub-menu with three TRD specific 
   items in addition to the system commands:

       4.1: FADC DISPLAY OF A WIRE - When this is selected, the HITS R-PHI 
                                DISPLAY is redrawn, and the user should click 
                                with the mouse on the wire for with the FADC 
                                trace is desired. Then the program draws three 
                                FADC traces, one for each layer and labels 
                                them with wire number and layer number.

       4.2: ENERGY AND WIRE -- When this is selected, the HITS R-PHI DISPLAY
                                is redrawn, and the user should click with the
                                mouse on the wire of interest. The program
                                displays its energy and wire number.

       4.3. ANODE/CATHODE - This is a toggle switch. The program will either 
                     display information from the ANODE or from the CATHODE 
                     depending how the toggle is set. The default is ANODE. 
                     Note: if the toggle is set to CATHODE, it will remain 
                     there for NEXT EVENT, and even if the user goes back to 
                     the main program and then requests event display again.
