                         SAMDIS - SAMUS Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION

      SAMDIS is the D0 Small Angle Muon System (SAMUS) event display. 
    It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in various
    frameworks. Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It displays module outlines, hits, and tracks in cut views,
    where a cross-section of the detector is displayed and hits and tracks 
    from these modules are projected onto this plane. Not all tracks
    and hits are displayed in a cut view. Tracks are color-coded according 
    to whether all their hits are from SAMUS, WAMUS or combined WAMUS+SAMUS.

II. GETTING a SAMUS DISPLAY

 A. Program builder 

    The package SAMDIS must be included in the package list to get 
    the SAMUS event display. To get combined displays, including CAL and
    ZTRAKS as well as WAMUS and SAMUS, use the package ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.
    (The % indicates it is a combined package).


 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@SAMUS_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals 

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI 

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are 
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the SAMUS display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_SAMDIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_SAMDIS_RCP.
    The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
    It also needs STP files to define the geometry. Logicals pointing
    to the default files are defined in the program builder file,
    SAMUS_USER.COM. If the user has included the package ALL_DISPLAY,
    the command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also be executed.
    (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2
 
       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER. 
   
       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes 
       consecutive).
