         This document describes the D0 Color/Line Style Table for
     programmers and users.   This document will help to implement
     the color table so it will be used to its best capability.

    
                                                                   Page  2
1)General Information: 
  --------------------                                                    

     The purpose  of  the  Color/Line  Style table is to allow the user to 
pick  a  color  for  his/her  display and not have to worry about what the 
output  is  going to look like in different devices.  The Color/Line Style 
Table  will take care of that.  It also provide a table with ordered  line 
styles to easy access for the user.

     The Color/Line  Style Table can create three tables for the user: the
Color Table, the Line Style Table and the Line Width Table.  Each of these 
are available to the user upon request. 
     

2)Color Table:
  ------------
     The  color table will give  17 different  colors to choose from.   It
will give  you  the  color  requested  or  its equivalent according to the 
device that you are in.   If  the user is in a monochrome monitor, display
will show solid blacjk lines.

   PXCOLR - It is equivalent to a JCOLOR call.

       Input: This routine has one input parameter:
                   COLOR [C*3]                                           
       COLOR: character  3  parameter that  should  have  the  first three 
       letters  of  the color requested.    If  the  color  desired  is  a 
       "Dark Col"  use DCO  as input  for COLOR.   Use the first letter of 
       Dark D and the first two letters of the color.  The letters  should 
       be all in caps.
       They input should be as follows:       COLOR
              ICTAB(1) - white                'WHI'
                   (2) - black                'BLA'
                   (3) - dark purple          'DPU'
                   (4) - purple               'PUR'
                   (5) - dark blue            'DBL'
                   (6) - blue                 'BLU'
                   (7) - cyan                 'CYA'
                   (8) - dark green           'DGR'
                   (9) - green                'GRE'
                  (10) - blue green           'BGR'
                  (11) - dark magenta         'DMA'
                  (12) - dark red             'DRE'
                  (13) - red                  'RED'
                  (14) - magenta              'MAG'
                  (15) - orange               'ORG'
                  (16) - yellow               'YEL'
                  (17) - foreground           'FOR'

      NOTE: When the PXCOLR  interface  routine  is used the user does not 
            make a JCOLOR call.    The routine will do all calls necessary  
            to perform the table color requested.
    
                                                                   Page  3

   PXCOLFILL-will access the color table and perform the color and filling
      operations equivalents to a JPIDEX and a JPINTR calls.

      If the user is in a monochrome monitor, it will provide a series of 
      grey shades instead of the colors.   If the user is in a monochrome 
      device  that  does  not  support  grey  shadings, different filling 
      patterns will be provided (TeKtronics).

      Input: COLOR [C*3]
      COLOR: character  3  parameter  that  should  have  the  first three 
      letters of the color requested. If the color desired if a "Dark Col" 
      use DCO as input for COLOR.   Use the first letter of Dark D and the 
      first two letters of the color.  The letters should be all in caps.

      NOTE:This routine will do all the operations necessary for a polygon 
            fill. 

   
3)Line Styles Table:
  ------------------
                                                                         
     This table have different line styles patterns available.   There are
10 different line styles available (dots, dashes, etc.).   The table has a 
total of 17 elements. After the first ten elements the line style patterns 
are repeated.

  PXLNSTY - This is equivalent to JLNSTYl.
      Input: This routine has one input parameter:
               INDX  [I]
      INDX: Integer parameter that will determine what line style the user 
      want. There are ten different line styles available to the user.  If 
      the user is using a S04 driver there are only will be six.  
      The line style patterns are the following:
            ICTAB(1) - solid line
                 (2) - small dashes
                 (3) - fine dots
                 (4) - two dots and a small dash
                 (5) - medium dots 
                 (6) - medium dashes
                 (7) - one dot medium dash
                 (8) - one dot larger dot
                 (9) - larger dashes
                (10) - much larger dashes
                (11) - same as (1)
                (12) - same as (2)
                (13) - same as (3)
                (14) - same as (4)
                (15) - same as (5)
                (16) - same as (6)
                (17) - solid 

    
                                                                   Page  4
4)Line Width Table:
  -----------------
   PXLWID - gives  a  table  that contains 17 differen line widths styles. 
           This table is ONLY available using a GPV driver.

       Input: Only one parameter
               INDX [I]
       INDX: Integer  that  will  determine what line width style the user
       want.


5)Direct Access Information:
  --------------------------

     The Color/Line  Style  Table  can  be access directly through PXCOLN. 
This method is recommend to be use by those that are familiar with DI300.

  Routine Name: PXCOLN

  Input: IDET   - [C*3] detector code (CDC, MUO, CAL)
         INDX   - [I] index corresponding to the ith element of the color, 
                  line style or line width table. (1 - 17 )
         ITYP   - [I] Table requested by the user:
                  0-for Line Style table, 
                  1-for Color table,
                  2-for Line Width Styles table (VAX Workstations ONLY),
                  3-for  Color  table  if  in  color device or  Line Width 
                    Styles if in monochrome device,
                  4-for Color table if in color  device  or  Line Style if 
                    in a monochrome device 
         IDEV   - [I] device num ( 1 or 2 ) assume 2 is B/W hardcopy
         CALFLG - [L] Flag  determining  if  the  user  wants  to  let the 
                  subroutine  make the  JCOLOR (Color table),  JLSTY (Line 
                  Style table) calls for him/her.  
                      .FALSE. - will not make the call for you
                      .TRUE.  - will make the calls 

  Output: KCOLOR - the color  parameter to be use in JCOLOR if the user is 
                   making his/her own calls.
          KINTEN - Color intensity code to be use in JPIDEX(KCOLOR,KINTEN)
          KFILL  - fill pattern code to be use in JPINTR calls
          KSTYL  - line style to be use in JLSTYL or JLWIDE calls

  Description: For  a  given detector, the calling routine can request the 
    nth color value, line style or width. The subroutine finds out whether 
    the device is color or black and white  and  the  type of driver it is 
    using to give the appropriate values to the table.

  Initialization: The  first  time the  routine is called with an ITYP the 
    device  type  will be inquired and the table will be set up  with  the 
    appropriate  values.   This  values  will remain  until  a new Ityp is 
    requested.
  
  Inputs: IDET - Eventually this  parameter  will be use adding a layer of 
    complication.    Detector  named  i with color input index j will give 
    color table index k i.e. for Cal the 1rst color maybe yellow while for 
    TRD 1rst color may be green.

    INDX - This  integer  represents  the index on the tables i.e. the ith 
    element in the respective table.

    ITYP - Determines what table (color/line styles) is going to be use.


                                                                   Page  5

    IDEV - This parameter is use to tell  the subroutine if it a  hardcopy 
    will  be use or not.  If IDEV is 1  the tables (color and line styles)
    will  set  up  for screen display  according to the device you are in.   
    If IDEV is 2 the table will be set up for hardcopy device LN03.   This 
    option has not been perfected jet and in the future it will be.    For
    now use IDEV equal to 1.

    CALFLG - The  user  can  call  PXCOLN  and then make his/her own color 
    calls  by setting CALFLG input parameter to FALSE.   If CALFLG is TRUE 
    the color/line  style table  will only make JCOLOR (if the color table 
    is  requested),  JLSTYL (if line  style table is requested), or JLWIDE 
    (if line width style table is requested).

                                                                   Page  6
  b)Line Styles Table:
    ------------------
         Using the GPV driver sets 10 line types:
            ILTAB(1) - solid
                 (2)--| 
                 (3)  |
                 (4)  |
                 (5)  |---> dot styles
                 (6)  |
                 (7)  |
                 (8)  |
                 (9)  |
                (10)--|                                                 
         Using  the  S04 driver  set 6 line styles repeating the 1st four 
         styles in the table twice.     
                                                                         
  c)Line Width Table:
    -----------------                                                      

   The  Line  Width  Table  is  only supported under the GPV driver.  This 
   table has seventeen different line width styles.  


  d)Color or Line Style Tables ?:
    -----------------------------

   The  input  parameter ITYP options 3 and 4 will give you an alternative
   might be useful. 

     These options  will  be  useful  when a  program  uses color lines to 
  differentiate lines in a display.  If the user is in  a color device the 
  colors  will  show  the  intended differences  and  if  the user is in a 
  monochrome device the display must use something  other  than  color  to 
  show the differences i.e line styles or line widths.  That's where these 
  options might be useful.   Remember that  the line width styles are ONLY 
  available in the GPV driver.
