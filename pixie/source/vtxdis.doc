                         VTXDIS  

                 VERTEX CHAMBER Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION

      VTXDIS is the D0 VERTEX tracking chamber (VTX) event display. 
    It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in various frameworks. 
    Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It can be combined with other detector's event display too.
    It displays the chamber layer and sector outlines, wires, hits, segments 
    and tracks as well as FADC traces. There are many choices to make the 
    display flexible. For example, one can select a phi region for the R-Z 
    view display. 
    If the event is fully reconstructed with the particle information, the
    dislay uses the colour to distinguish the different particles:
    Green track indicates this track is in a muon road,
    Red track indicates this track is in an electron road,
    Blue track indicates that this track is in a tau road and
    Yellow track indicates that this track contributed to a Vee.

II. GETTING a VTX DISPLAY

 A. Program builder 

    The package VTXDIS must be included in the package list to get the VTX
    event display. To get combined displays for the Central Detector's all 
    subdetectors, just use the package CDDIS_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or
    CD_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for EXAMINE2. To get combined displays, 
    including CAL, MUON and all CD subdetectors just use the package 
    ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for 
    EXAMINE. 

    To do VTX reconstruction and make VTX event display in the same program,
    the package VTRAKS and VTXDIS should be both included.
    For example to make such a D0USER one should run PBD as:
    $ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACKAGE=(VTRAKS,VTXDIS)/NAME=xxxx

 B. LINK

    The normal D0USER link does not include the event display
    package. One needs to do: $@VTX_D0USER.LNK DI3000
    or $@ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.LNK DI3000.
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to
    pick up the latest event display routines and parameters.

 C. Setup for RUN


   1. DI3000 logicals 

      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do
      $SETUP DI3000 or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node
      and execute DILOGIN.COM

      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI 

    $SETDRV cod1 cod2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

    The first driver should correspond to the type of terminal you are 
    logged on to; the second one to a hardcopy device[ e.g. TLP ].

    For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

 2. PIXIE logicals. The event display needs a RCP file to define the views
    to be displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
    For the VTX display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_VTXDIS.RCP.
    The corresponding logical is PX_VTXDIS_RCP.
    The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
    It also needs STP files to define the geometry. Logicals pointing
    to the default files are defined in the program builder file,
    VTX_D0USER.COM or ALL_DISPLAY_D0USER.COM. When doing ALL_DISPLAY,
    the command file D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY.COM must also be executed.
    (This procedure does $SETDRV and sets up the STP files.)

 D. RUNNING

    1. Running EXAMINE2
 
       After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
       "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

    2.  Running D0USER. 
   
       There are two ways to use event display. The first
       is to turn on the interactive menu and then, while analyzing
       events, do a DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
       One can also turn on the automatic event display by doing
       EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before starting the run. It will ask how
       many events and their particular IDs (if -1 then assumes 
       consecutive).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 VTX_R-PHI_VIEW -  Displays the Vertex R Phi view. This view show vertex chamber
                   hits, track segments, wire positions and sector boundaries
                   depending on the values of the interactive parameters. It 
                   also show phi road limits in yellow outside the VTX chamber.
      
 VTX_R-Z_VIEW - Displays the Vertex R-Z view. This view shows hits and tracks 
                    with phi between PHI1 and PHI2 in the upper (+R) plot and
                    hits and tracks with phi between PHI1+180 and PHI2+180 in 
                    the bottom (-R) plot. This view allows a phi road cut for 
                    the display. The cut value is defined for the Upper half of
                    the VTX. The lower part is always displays the opposite 
                    region in phi from the upper part.
                    There are three ways to choose a phi road:
                         . use the default (0.0 - 180.0 degree). That means
                           you display the tracks in a full phi region 
                         . use PHI region from PX_SYSTEM.RCP. That means
                           you display the tracks in the same phi cut region 
                           as in the other detectors (for a combined package
                           with other detector's displays).
                         . enter the phi road cut values by yourself. By this
                           way you can choose any phi region for the display
                           as you like.

                     Here is an example when you want to get a VTX_R-Z view
                     display with a phi region selected between 30 degree
                     to 60 degree. You can answer these questions 
                     inteactively.
                         
        Phi from   0.0 to 180.0 (degree) Y/N> (?:for help; default:Y) ?
            The VTX R-Z view display is split into two hemispheres.
            The Upper hemisphere is shown on the upper part of the screen,
            The Lower hemisphere is shown on the lower part of the screen.
            One can select a phi region for the R-Z view display.
            The phi region has to be defined for the Upper part. The lower
            part is always the opposite region in phi for the upper hemisphere.

        Phi from   0.0 to 180.0 (degree) Y/N> (?:for help; default:Y) N
            select a mode to determine the phi region for the R-Z display
            0: default (0. - 180. degree)
            1: use PHI values from PX_SYSTEM.RCP
            2: enter PHI values by yourself

        Enter the mode number [0 or 1 or 2] (default is 0) 2

        Enter minimum PHI value [0.0 - 180.0 degree]: 30.0

        Enter maxmum PHI value  [0.0 - 180.0 degree]: 60.0


 VTX_Z-Y VIEW - Displays the vertex Z-Y view, which is useful when the VTX
         hits have been used to calculate the vertex Z position. The display
         shows the hits used the in calculation (usually the first and last 
         wires of a sector) in a different color from the other hits. The
         vertex Z position is marked with a small green x.

 VTX_FADC_WIRES - Displays the FADC wires. The user can plot 8 FADC traces
         for all the wires in a sector, whose sector number is entered 
         interactively, or plot a user chosen channel number, which gives 
         one FADC trace and its first differential. Defaults and limits are 
         printed as well as requests for user input.

 VTX_FADC_STRIPS - Displays FADC traces for the strips, when the user 
          specifys either a channel number, which gives 1 FADC trace and its 
          1st Diff. or layer number, which gives the FADC traces for 8 strips. 
          Defaults and limits are printed as well as requests for user input.
