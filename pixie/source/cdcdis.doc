                         CDCDIS - CDC Event Display

 I. INTRODUCTION

      CDCDIS is the package for D0 Central Drift Chamber (CDC) event display. 
    It is part of the PIXIE library, which can be run in various frameworks. 
    Hooks are set up for PIXIE in D0USER and EXAMINE2. (See .DOCs)
    It can be combined with other detector's event display too.
    It displays the chamber layer and sector outlines, wires, hits, segments 
    and tracks as well as FADC traces. There are many choices to make the 
    display flexible. For example, one can select a phi region for the R-Z 
    view display. 
    If the event is fully reconstructed with the particle information, the
    dislay uses the colour to distinguish the different particles:
    Green track indicates this track is in a muon road,
    Red track indicates this track is in an electron road,
    Blue track indicates that this track is in a tau road and
    Yellow track indicates that this track contributed to a Vee.


II. GETTING a CDC DISPLAY

  A. Program Builder 

    The package CDCDIS must be included in the package list to get the CDC 
    event display. To get combined displays for the Central Detector's all 
    subdetectors, just use the package CDDIS_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or
    CD_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for EXAMINE2. To get combined displays, 
    including CAL, MUON and all CD subdetectors just use the package 
    ALL_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for D0USER or D0_DISPLAY_COMBINED.PBD for 
    EXAMINE. To do CDC reconstruction and make CD event display in the 
    same program, the package DTRAKS and CDCDIS should be both included.
    For example to make a D0USER which can do CDC reconstruction and CDC
    display, one should run PBD as:
    $ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACKAGE=(DTRAKS,CDCDIS)/NAME=xxxx


  B. Link

    Once the package CDCDIS is included in your PBD command, the DI3000
    have to be include in the link command.
    For example,
    $ @xxxx_D0USER.LNK DI3000
    
    Also, it is usually best to do a $LIBT PIXIE in order to pick up the 
    latest event display routines and parameters.


  C. Setup for Run

   1. DI3000 Logicals 
      If the DI3000 logicals are not automatically setup, do

      $SETUP DI3000 

      or find out where DI3000 is stored on your node and execute DILOGIN.COM.
      The sharable version of DI3000 should be requested by the command:

      $ DISETSHR EXT HI 

      $ SETDRV driv1 driv2 ! to setup the DI3000 device Drivers.

      The first driver driv1 should correspond to the type of terminal you are 
      logged on to; the second one driv2 to a hardcopy device [e.g. LN3].

      For more information see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

   2. PIXIE Logicals. 
      The event display needs a RCP file to define the views to be 
      displayed and the interactive parameters which control them.
      For the CDC display, the file needed is D0$PIXIE:PX_CDCDIS.RCP.
      The corresponding logical is PX_CDCDIS_RCP.
      The user may redirect the RCP logicals to their own files.
      The logicals pointing to the default files are defined in the 
      program builder file, xxxx_D0USER.COM.  Execute:

      $ @xxxx_D0USER

      to get all RCP logicals defined.

   3. STP File Logical
      The CDC display also needs STP file to define the geometry. There 
      are two default STP files for CDC in the library: one is for Monte
      Carlo data and one is for real data. Execute the following command 
      file, you will get proper STP file for your data:

      $ @D0$D0USER:EVENT_DISPLAY

      (This procedure setup STP file and does $SETDRV)

  D. Running

   1. Running EXAMINE2
      After "BEGIN PROCESSING" in EXAMINE2, choose menu item
      "EVENT DISPLAY" in the INTERRUPT menu.

   2. Running D0USER. 
      There are two ways to use event display. The first is to turn on 
      the interactive menu and then, while analyzing events, do a 
      DISPLAY EVENT. This will start at a random event.
      One can also turn on the automatic event display by select the item
      EVENT DISPLAYS (7) before entering the input data file. It will ask 
      how many events and their particular IDs (answer -1, if you want to
      start the event display from the first event).

*CDCDIS Menu Title    * Function & Remark                                    *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1: CDC_X-Y view -    shows a X-Y view of CDC event display. It can show
                        the chamber layer and sector outlines, sector numbers,
                        the sense wires, all hits, all tracks, track numbers,
                        and the hits on the tracks.
                        If the parameter CDC ONLY is true, the tracks will be
                        extended to the center of the CDC. If the parameter
                        CDC ONLY is false, the tracks will be drawn within
                        CDC region.

   2: CDC_R-Z view -    shows a R-Z view of CDC event display. It can show
                        the chamber outlines, beam lines, delay lines, all 
                        delay line hits, all tracks which have theta 
                        information, track numbers, reconstructed vertex,
                        isajet vertex if the isajet information is available
                        and a dimension scale at the down-right corner.
                        The R-Z view also allows a phi road cut for the display.
                        The cut value is defined for the Upper half of the CDC.
                        The lower part is always displays the opposite region 
                        in phi for the upper part.
                        There are three ways to choose a phi road:
                         . use the default (0.0 - 180.0 degree). That means
                           you display the tracks in a full phi region 
                         . use PHI region from PX_SYSTEM.RCP. That means
                           you display the tracks in the same phi cut region 
                           as in the other detectors (for a combined package
                           with other detector's displays).
                         . enter the phi road cut values by yourself. By this
                           way you can choose any phi region for the display
                           as you like.

                         Here is an example when you want to get a CDC_R-Z view
                         display with a phi region selected between 30 degree
                         to 60 degree. You can answer these questions 
                         inteactively.
                         
        Phi from   0.0 to 180.0 (degree) Y/N> (?:for help; default:Y) ?
            The CDC R-Z view display is split into two hemispheres.
            The Upper hemisphere is shown on the upper part of the screen,
            The Lower hemisphere is shown on the lower part of the screen.
            One can select a phi region for the R-Z view display.
            The phi region has to be defined for the Upper part. The lower
            part is always the opposite region in phi for the upper hemisphere.

        Phi from   0.0 to 180.0 (degree) Y/N> (?:for help; default:Y) N
            select a mode to determine the phi region for the R-Z display
            0: default (0. - 180. degree)
            1: use PHI values from PX_SYSTEM.RCP
            2: enter PHI values by yourself

        Enter the mode number [0 or 1 or 2] (default is 0) 2

        Enter minimum PHI value [0.0 - 180.0 degree]: 30.0

        Enter maxmum PHI value  [0.0 - 180.0 degree]: 60.0

   3: CDC_X-Y Segments: shows a X-Y view of CDC segments display. It is as same
                        as the CDC_X-Y display except that it displays all
                        segments (track within a layer) instead of tracks.

   4: CDC_3Sec Segments%: This is a combined display. It contains two displays:
                        On the left side of the screen, it is a FADC trace 
                        display which shows the trigger pulse signal.
                        On the right side of the screen, it is a CDC_X-Y
                        segments display for 3 sectors only. One can choose
                        the item MODIFY to change the parameter CDC SECTOR
                        to select the sectors you want to display. The 
                        parameter CDC SECTOR indicates the middle sector's
                        number. (The default value for CDC SECTOR is 1, so
                        the default display is for sector 0, 1 and 2).
                      
  5: CDC_1layer FADCs:  It shows 7 sense wires's FADC traces and 4 delay line
                        readout's FADC traces in a given layer and a sector. 
                        The layer and sector numbers are defined by the 
                        parameter CDC LAYER and CDC SECTOR. One can choose
                        the item MODIFY to change the parameters. The default
                        values are:
                        CDC LAYER       0
                        CDC SECTOR      1

  6: CDC_One_FADC:      It shows a FADC trace for a specific channel. Which 
                        FADC is in display is determined by the parameters:
                        CDC LAYER, CDC SECTOR and CDC FADC.
                        One can choose the item MODIFY to change the parameter
                        values. The default values are:
                        CDC LAYER       0
                        CDC SECTOR      1
                        CDC FADC        0
                  
  7: CDC_4layer FADCs%  It shows a complete FADC traces for a sector. It 
                        includes the 28 sense wires and 16 delay line readouts
                        devided into 4 layers.  The sector number is determined
                        by the parameter CDC SECTOR. 
                        One can choose the item MODIFY to change the parameter
                        value. The default value is:
                        CDC SECTOR      1

  8: CDC_3sec Tracks:   It shows the CDC_X-Y view track display for 3 sectors
                        only for a more close look at these three sectors.
                        One can choose the item MODIFY to change the parameter 
                        CDC SECTOR to select the sectors you want to display. 
                        The parameter CDC SECTOR indicates the middle sector's
                        number. (The default value for CDC SECTOR is 1, so
                        the default display is for sector 0, 1 and 2).

  9: CDC_3D View:       It is a 3D view of the CDC display, which includes
                        the dislay of the CDC outer line, sectors, wires,
                        hits and tracks. Only the hits and tracks, which have
                        3D information are shown. i.e. the hits on the inner
                        sense wires are not shown, since their Z information
                        are unknown. The hits display is controled by the
                        parameter "CDC DRAW 3D HITS":
                        draw 3D hits = 1 all hits are same color (purple)
                        draw 3D hits = 2 mark hit on track (blue)
                        draw 3D hits = 3 mark mirror hits (+phi purple;
                                                           -phi green)
                        The default value is:
                        CDC DRAW 3D HITS      3
                        The tracks in 3D display can be controled by the
                        parameter "CDC DRAW TRKS" and "CDC IMPACT CUT". 
                        Only those tracks, which passes the impact parameter 
                        cut, are drawn in 3D. The default values are:
                        CDC DRAW 3D TRKS      1  
                        CDC IMPACT CUT     50.0  
                        i.e. draw all the tracks cross CDC inner wall.
                        This 3D view can be rotated on VAXSTATIONS or the 
                        Evans and Sutherland, using the ROTATE command.
