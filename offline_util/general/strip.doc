    The package STRIP is intended to be used within the CALOR_OFF framework
  to selectively strip events from a file. This package can be used by itself,
  or in combination with other packages. As currently coded the package allows
  the user to select events by:

    a.)  Run and event number
    b.)  Level 1 trigger bit
    c.)  Level 2 trigger bit
    d.)  Coincidence between level1 and level2 Trigger bits.

    The package is fully controlled via RCP file (STRIP_RCP) and combinations 
  of the above are allowed.

    The package makes use of the flag 'WRITE_THIS_EVENT', which is initially
 set to FALSE. If the event fulfills any of the RCP-allowed criteria, this
 flag is set TRUE, and the event is written. If you are using subsequent
 packages which reset this flag, be aware that the results can be confusing.

    This package does not currently support multiple output streams, except for
  STA and DST. This output is controlled by CALFRAME.RCP where either 
  STANDARD_OUT or DST_OUT has to be TRUE, else no output will be written.

    Note that the logical STRIP_EVENT is also set, so if combined with other
  succeeding packages, analysis is skipped for events not passing the criteria.
  (One could also include a user criterion, but if you're that involved in 
  coding, you already know what you're doing.)
