D0HCMP a Histogram Comparison/Verification Package

It is a set of utilities to list, sum up, and compare/verify HBOOK histograms.
It consists out of three elements

D0HCMP_HST_RCP, D0HCMP_ADD and D0HCMP_VERI.

D0HCMP_HST_RCP makes a list of histograms in an HBOOK RZ file 

D0HCMP_ADD sums up histograms

D0HCMP_VERI   checks  histograms  against  other  ones in a  reference  file. It
basically calls  HBOOK HDIFF routine  which performs  Kolmogorov test (see HBOOK
manual).

All the three packages are rcp driven. To use them one needs to define

$   DEFINE D0HCMP_VERI_RCP D0HCMP_VERI.RCP
$   DEFINE D0HCMP_ADD_RCP  D0HCMP_ADD.RCP
$   DEFINE D0HCMP_HST_RCP_RCP  D0HCMP_HST_RCP.RCP

and then run specific exes. 

The RCP files are  commented and are self  explanatory. There is a print flag In
each of them  LHPRINT  which controlls  wheater the  processed  (or in question)
histograms are printed or not.
