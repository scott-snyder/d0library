                    Level 1 and Level 2 Bit routines

You can find which level 1 and level 2 bits fired with logical functions
 
    L1_PASSED()   to see if ANY level 1 bit passed
and L2_PASSED()   to see if ANY level 2 bit passed
 
For bit by bit information, use
 
    L1BIT_PASSED(I) where I ranges from 0 to 31
and L2BIT_PASSED(J) where J ranges from 0 to 127
 
NOTE:
    These four routines will work on any event which has the event header.
HOWEVER, L2BIT_PASSED(J) only REALLY gives the right results on events for which
the FILT bank has been kept.  Otherwise, it reports the weaker results of
L2BIT_ON(J).  In this case, a bit can be reported as ON if it was not TRIED, but
some other level 2 bit caused the event to pass.

    There also exists L2BIT_TRIED(J).

    L2BIT_UNBIASED(J) tells if this event is was one of an unbiased sample
passed along for filter efficiency measurements.

    Efficiency can be measured either by UNBIASED events, or by events
in which a DIFFERENT L2BIT_PASSED is true (which provides a different unbiased
sample): 

    IF (L2BIT_PASSED(J)) THEN
        IF (L2BIT_TRIED(I)) THEN
            IF (L2BIT_PASSED(I)) THEN
                yes(i)
            ELSE
                no(i)
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ENDIF

    There are other functions available which give more detailed information:

    L2BIT_ON(J) or L2BIT_WRITE(J)       (synonmys)
        ON means that the script either passed or was never tried or was chosen
        to be part of the unbiased sample (pass 1 of n)
            (i.e. the WRITE bit was on for this filter)

    L2BIT_SET(J)
        SET means that the level 1 bit which this script requires was set

More Detail:
------------

SET  means the script was eligible to try this event, i.e. its level 1 bit
        fired.  

ON   means that the script result was to allow writing of the event.  The real 
        result of level 2.  It's what is kept in the event header.
     also called the WRITE bit

TRY means the script was actually run to produce a real result.  

PASS means the script was actually run and actually passed.

UNBIASED means that a counter hit the value requested to write out the event
    regardless of the outcome of filtering (pass 1 of n)

The conditions we need to reconstruct are:
                                                                        need:
1. used by data logger to write streams: ON                             ON

2. used by RECO to decide whether to rerun filter (?) 
        Rerun = .NOT.TRY                                                TRY

3. useable to cross check trigger efficiency:
    (test bit a only when bit b is ON.AND.PASS)                       (ON,)PASS
            (PASS implies ON, so only PASS need be tested)
    GOOD = TRY.AND.PASS; BAD = TRY.AND..NOT.PASS                        TRY,PASS

4. useable to measure trigger efficiency directly:

    GOOD = UNB.AND.PASS; BAD = UNB.AND..NOT.PASS                        UNB,PASS
        which tags an event as among the UNBiased sample.

The breakdown of cases:
    Redundancy: PASS => TRY
                PASS => ON
                UNB => ON
                UNB => TRY
                TRY.OR.ON => SET

SET ON  TRY PASS    comments
F   F   F   F       ignore this bit this event--couldn't have been tried
F   ---any T---     ILLEGAL : ran on a bit it shouldn't have 
T   F   F   F       ILLEGAL : should have SET = (ON.OR.TRY)
T   F   F   T       ILLEGAL : If PASS, must have TRY and ON
T   F   T   F       Failure : another bit is ON, so this isn't unbiased write
T   F   T   T       ILLEGAL : if it passes, it should be ON
T   T   F   F       Possible: never tried (another bit must be on)
T   T   F   T       ILLEGAL : if PASS, must have TRY
T   T   T   F       Failed, but written on pass 1 of n (unbiased)
T   T   T   T       Certified: TRIED AND PASSED

So to summarize the Legal states:
F   F   F   F       ignore this bit this event--couldn't have been tried
T   T   F   F       Possible: never tried (another bit must be on)
T   T   T   T       Certified: TRIED AND PASSED
                        unfortunately, those in the unbiased sample are not
                        marked.
T   F   T   F       Failure : another bit is ON, so this isn't unbiased write
                        if the other trigger is interesting, can use this to
                        measure efficiency by also looking at T T T T with the
                        other bit on
T   T   T   F       Failed, but written as part of unbiased sample
