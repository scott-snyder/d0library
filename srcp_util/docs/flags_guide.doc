Introduction
------------
    This note describes a software tool for handling dynamically defined
flags. Unlike the flags which can be read in from a parameter file and
stored in the ZEBRA bank called SRCP (see GTSRCP_MANUAL.MEM) the facility
described here handles TEMPORARY flags; the flags are temporary in the
sense that they do not reside in a ZEBRA bank which can be written to disk.
In fact, the flag facility does not use ZEBRA at all. If a record of the
name and truth value of a flag is required use the GTSRCP facility.

Brief write-up of routines
--------------------------
    All subroutine names of the flag facility start with FLG. To use
the flag facility a programmer needs to be aware of 6 subroutines:


o   FLGBK (NAME,NUMBER) 

    Purpose:    Book one or more flags; routine can be called any number
                of times. If a name is already booked the program will
                send a message to the screen, generate a file FLAGS.LIST
                with a list of flags listed so far and ABORT. Note that
                it is more efficient to book flags by supplying an array
                than by calling it once per flag.

    Input:      NAME    Character*16 array of flag names.
                NUMBER  Number of flags to book.

o   FLGCHK(NAME)

    Purpose:    Logical function, return value true if flag NAME has been
                booked, return false if not.

    Input:      NAME    name of flag


o   FLGERR (IER) 

    Purpose:    Return error code after a call to any of the flag
                subroutines.

    Output:     IER     Error code; IER = 0 if all is OK.


o   FLGPR (LUN) 

    Purpose:    Write to unit LUN the list of booked flags and their truth
                values.

    Input:      LUN     Logical Unit Number.


o   FLGSET (NAME,TRUTH) 

    Purpose:    Set the truth value of specified flag.
                Error code is set to -3 if flag was NOT booked.

    Input:      NAME    Name of flag.
                TRUTH   Truth value (either .TRUE. or .FALSE.).


o   FLGUBK (NAME,NUMBER)

    Purpose:    Unbook flags; same arguments as FLGBK.


o   FLGVAL (NAME)

    Purpose:    Logical function which is set to the truth value of specified 
                flag. Note: if a flag has not been booked FLGVAL will return
                a truth value of FALSE and error code is -3.


Notes
-----

    This facility has been designed to be fast, therefore, certain checks
performed by GTSRCP are not done, resulting in the following restrictions:

    o   The facility is CASE-SENSITIVE;

    o   Flag names should NOT contain leading blanks;

    o   Names must be less than or equal to 16 characters.
