 29-FEB-1992 : Modifications released by Herbert Greenlee
 
    - This release contains bug fixes to official_release and test_release
      that caused them to sometimes fail to insert the version subroutine in
      the libraries.  Also test_release sometimes updated the official instead
      of the test parent libraries.

    - Added lib$date_time and str$trim rtl emulation routines.

    - Added -d option to official_release, test_release and lib_sect.
