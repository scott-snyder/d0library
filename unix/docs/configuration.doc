                         D0library Configuration in UNIX



        This file summarizes the configuration files and environment
        variables that can be modified as part of the configuration
        of d0library.

        Configuration files
        -------------------

        1.  d0local.login and d0local.cshrc.

            These files, local versions of which may may be found in 
            /usr/local/etc or some other machine dependent directory,
            set up the d0 environment for all users.  The local versions
            source the default versions $d0unix/shell.  It is the job
            of d0local.login to set all environment variables needed
            by the d0 environment.  d0local.cshrc sets aliases and
            shell variables.  Note that, unlike environment variables,
            aliases and shell variables are not normally configured on a 
            per-user or per-system basis.  Operating system dependencies 
            are coded for all supported systems in 
            $d0unix/shell/d0local.cshrc

        2.  ~d0librar/.login and ~d0librar/.cshrc.

            These are the login files for the d0library account, which
            usually has a username of d0librar, but that is not required.
            These files should source the local versions of d0local.login
            and d0local.cshrc.  In addition, they should setup cernlib so
            that certain required cernlib executables (e.g. zftp and
            patchy) are found in $PATH.  It also desirable to libtest
            (or libtest -g) the unix library.  They may define environment
            variables that are not defined in d0local.login or override
            the defitions definitions found there.

        3.  ~d0librar/.netrc

            For remote access to VAX systems (e.g. $VAXLIB_NODE) via
            ftp, zftp and rexec.  See ftp man page or 
            d0$unix$docs:fatmen.doc.  Also see d0$unix$docs:fatmen.doc
            for recommendations on how to set the login.com on the
            remote VAX account.

        4.  daily_update.

            This is the name of the cron job that runs daily via cron to 
            update d0library.  There is an example in 
            $d0library/unix/shell, but normally this would be copied
            and modified for a specific system.  Some examples of 
            things that may be modified are given below:

            a) Definitions of environment variables.

            b) Updating of d0dad catalogue.

            c) Local cleanup procedures.

            d) Whether to send mail to czars following releases.

        5.  $d0library/sections.

            This file contains a list of library sections that are to 
            be part of d0library.  If it is missing, the default set of 
            sections found in $d0unix/shell/sections, is used instead.
            This file is always accessed via the d0 shell script lib_sect.

        Environment Variables
        ---------------------

        1.  d0library.

            The root of d0library.  Normally set in d0local.login.
            May be overridden by setting d0library in .login and .cshrc
            before sourcing d0local.login and d0local.cshrc.

        2.  prod.

            The root of the production area (used by libprod).  
            Normally set in d0local.login.

        3.  VAXLIB_NODE.

            The name of a VAX node from which to update d0library.
            Normally set in d0local.login.  May be redefined at
            any time.

        4.  ZFTP_NODE.

            Optional name of a VAX node from which to fetch files
            using zftp.  If undefined, VAXLIB_NODE is used instead.
            Normally set in d0local.login.

        5.  FATMEN_NODE.

            Optional name of a VAX node on which to access fatmen 
            catalogue (see d0$unix$docs:fatmen.doc).  If undefined, 
            VAXLIB_NODE is used.  Normally set in d0local.login.

        6.  TMPDIR.

            Optional root of temporary file area.  If undefined, a
            default such as /usr/tmp or /var/tmp is used.  This
            variable is normally not defined in d0local.login, but
            in a user's .login.  It is recommended that the d0library
            account have this variable defined.
