                              FATMEN in UNIX


        The VMS file translation utilities built into D0OPEN, 
        PARSE_FILES/SEARCH_FILES and other utilities based on the 
	LIB$FIND_FILE emulator have been modified to work with FATMEN 
	generic names.  This means that input to standard d0 programs, 
	such as the d0user frame, can be specified as FATMEN generic 
	names, including wildcards where appropriate (but Krzysztof 
	does not like wildcards -- see section on prestaging).  As in 
	VMS, tape resident files are staged and read from the staging 
	area on D0FS.

	How to use FATMEN generic names
	-------------------------------

	The LIB$FIND_FILE emulator uses remote execution of the FATMEN
	shell to expand FATMEN wildcards and to locate and if necessary 
	stage the files corresponding FATMEN generic names.  Remote
	execution takes place on the VMS node specified in the environment
	variable FATMEN_NODE defined in /usr/local/etc/d0local.login
	on the local sgi and ibm clusters.

	For remote execution to work smoothly, it is necessary to 
	configure one's accounts in UNIX and VMS as follows:

	1.  Remote user validation is via the .netrc mechanism.  You must 
	    enter $FATMEN_NODE into your .netrc file.  Refer to the ftp
	    man page for the format of .netrc.  Remember to read-protect
	    your .netrc ("chmod go-r .netrc").  You do not need a remote
            .rhosts file.  Here is an example of a .netrc entry:

	    machine d0gs04.fnal.gov
	    login greenlee
	    password xyz123

	2.  It is best to modify your login.com on $FATMEN_NODE to do
	    nothing when it is invoked by a remote execution -- not
	    even d0local.com.  This can be accomplished by following
	    the instructions in d0news message 971 in the general
	    folder on FNALD0 (set archive).  This d0news message 
	    recommends putting the following commands before d0local.com:

	    $ tt = f$extract( 0, 3, f$trnlnm( "tt" ) - "_" - ":" )
	    $ if ( (tt .eqs. "WSA") .or. (tt .eqs. "MBA") ) then exit

	3.  You can test your configuration by issuing a simple remote
	    execution interactively in UNIX:

	    % d0rexec $FATMEN_NODE "sh log tt"

	    You should see the output of the VMS command and nothing else.


	Stand Alone Utilities.
	----------------------

	The standard interactive file translation utilities can now be
	used with FATMEN generic names.  These utilities accept one or
	more filenames, which can be specified on the command line or
	via standard input.  The uf utilities generate output in the 
	form of FATMEN generic names.  That is, they only expand wildcards
	and do filtering.  The vf utilities also perform a find operation.
	They stage the file if necessary and generate output in the form
	of UNIX absolute pathnames pointing to D0FS.  A full description
	of the use of these utilities for regular files is found in 
	d0$unix$docs:unix_utilities.mem.  Here is a summary of their use
	with generic names.

	ufa 	 - Expand wildcards.
	uff 	 - Expand wildcard but only output the first match.
	ufl, ufn - Expand wildcards and ensure uniqueness (e.g. print
		   only one match) for all fields of a generic name 
		   following the run number (for data) or generator 
		   (for Monte Carlo).

	vfa	 - Expand wildcards and find all of the files specified.
	vff	 - Expand and find the first file specified.

	The utilities vfl and vfn work as they do for normal VMS
	filenames (that is they ensure the uniqueness of the tail and
	name portion of the output filenames), but it is better to
	use ufl or ufn to filter the generic names first and then pipe
	the output to vfa.  For example, use

	% cat fatmen_names | ufl | vfa > file_names

	rather than

	% cat fatmen_names | vfl > file_names

	Prestaging
	----------

	Krzystof now recommends prestaging files.  Since full tape staging
	is about to be turned off, prestaging will be necessary to get
	reasonable performance.  A new standalone utility has been
	defined to access the prestage utility (@D0$FATMEN:PRESTAGE) 
	via remote execution.  Like the file filters, prestage
	accepts fatmen names via the command line or standard input.
	For example:

	% cat fatmen_names | prestage
