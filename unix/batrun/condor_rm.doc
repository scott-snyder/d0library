   NAME
     condor_rm - remove jobs from the condor queue

   SYNOPSIS
     condor_rm cluster_id[.proc_id] ...
     condor_rm user_name ...

   DESCRIPTION

     Condor_rm removes one or more jobs from the condor queue.  If a
     cluster_id and a process_id are both specified, condor_rm attempts to
     remove the specified process from the queue.  If a cluster_id is speci-
     fied without a process_id, condor_rm attempts to remove all processes
     belonging to the specified cluster.  If a user_name is specified,
     condor_rm attempts to remove all jobs belonging to that user.  Only the
     owner of a job or the super user can remove it.
