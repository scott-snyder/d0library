   NAME
     condor_q - display the local condor job queue

   SYNOPSIS
     condor_q [-l] [cluster_id[.proc_id]] ...

   DESCRIPTION

     Condor_q displays information about jobs in the local condor job queue.
     If a cluster_id and a process_id are both specified, condor_q displays
     information about the specified process.  If a cluster_id is specified
     without a process_id, condor_q displays information about all processes
     belonging to the specified cluster.  With no arguments condor_q displays
     information about all condor jobs in the local queue.  Condor_q displays
     a one line summary of information about specified processes as follows:

     ID        The cluster/process id of the condor job.

     OWNER     The owner of the job.

     SUBMITTED The month, day, hour, and minute the job was submitted to the
               queue.

     CPU_USAGE Remote CPU time accumulated by the job to date in days, hours,
               minutes, and seconds.  If the job is currently running, time
               accumulated during the current run is not shown.

     ST        Current status of the job.  U = unexpanded (never been run), R
               = running, I = idle (waiting for a machine to execute on), C =
               completed, and X = removed.

     PRI       User specified priority of the job, ranges from -20 to +20,
               with higher numbers corresponding to greater priority.

     SIZE      The virtual image size of the executable in megabytes.

     COMMAND   The name of the executable.

   OPTIONS

     -l   Causes the full description for each job to be displayed instead of
          just a summary.  For details see the -l option described in the
          manual page.
