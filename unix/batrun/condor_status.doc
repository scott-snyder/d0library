   NAME
     condor_status - examine the condor machine pool

   SYNOPSIS
     condor_status [-p] [-l] [-h hostname] [machine_name] ...

   DESCRIPTION

     Condor_status displays information about machines in the condor machine
     pool.  Condor_status displays a one line summary of information about
     specified machines as follows:

     NAME The network name of the machine.

     RUN  The number of condor jobs the machine is executing remotely.

     TOTAL
          The total number of condor jobs in the machine's local job queue.

     PRIORITY
          The priority the machine has with the condor central manager for
          obtaining machines on which to run jobs.  Priorities range from
          negative to positive infinity, with 0 being "neutral".  Higher
          numbers correspond to greater priority.

     STATE
          State of the machine regarding hosting condor jobs for others.
          NoJob     - not hosting any jobs.
          Run  - executing a job for another machine.
          Susp - hosting a job, but holding it in temporary suspension.
          Ckpt - hosting a job, but have asked it to checkpoint and leave.
          Kill - hosting a job, but in process of forcing it off.

     LOAD AVERAGE
          The 1 minute load average.

     KEYBOARD IDLE TIME
          Time since the last keystroke on any tty or pty on the machine.

     MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
          The CPU architecture of the machine.

     OPERATING SYSTEM
          The operating system running on the machine.

   OPTIONS

     -p   Causes machines to be displayed in priority order, otherwise they
          are displayed in alphabetic order.  In either case, they are
          grouped according to CPU type and operating system.

     -l   Causes the full description for each machine to be displayed
          instead of just a summary.


                                                                            1






   CONDOR_STATUS(1)                                              Version 4.1b


     -h hostname
          Hostname should be the internet address of a host which is acting
          as the central manager of a condor pool.  Causes condor_summary to
          contact the specified host to get status information about machines
          in its condor pool, (which may be different than your own).

     machine_name ...
          Causes status information to be displayed for only the host(s)
          listed.  Normally status information is listed for every machine in
          the pool.

   BUGS
     Each machine periodically sends the central manager a snapshot of its
     situation.  Since the information returned by condor_status is a collec-
     tion of such snapshots, all taken at varying times, the total picture
     may not be completely consistent.  For example, the reported total
     number of jobs running and the sum of machines reported to be in the
     "Run", "Susp", "Ckpt", and "Kill" states should match, but they may not.
