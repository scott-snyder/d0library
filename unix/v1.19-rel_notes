 24-APR-1992 : Modifications released by Herbert Greenlee
 
    - Bug fix in installation script.

    - Improved installation script for first-time installation.

    - Added protection to official_release and test_release against fetch
      failure.  The old version could destroy a library if the fetch failed.
