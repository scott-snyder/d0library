                        CL2TEST package
                          Version 1.0

Usage:
======
    no other packages are required.
    be sure to have at least /ZEBSTP=300000 on the PBD line used to build your
        package
    seven RCP banks are used: CALEVT, CAHITS, CALICD, CL2HITS,L1C, L2JETS and
CL2TEST.  
    If you use this package in combination with other packages, be sure to check
the .COM file generated by program builder and set the LAST occurrence of
the logical rcpname_RCP to whatever value you want, since other packages might
ask for the same RCP file.  The electron and jet candidates are selected by the
Level 1 configuration file you choose.

    This package compares a Level 2 and offline CAEP bank, and records some
information about the accuracy with which the tables to do the level 2
conversion are made, and does timing tests, under control of CL2TEST.RCP.  
It is mainly intended for the use of the implementor.

The output appears on:
    FOR003.DAT  general zebra information, and an overview of the STP banks
        generated.
    FOR007.DAT  ERRMSG LOG file (more information than usual)
    USER.OUT statistics, histograms, and discrepant channels
    some further output appears on D0USER_xxxx.OUT

    The package calls the parts of the CALOR, CAHITS, CL2HITS, L2JETS, and
L1C packages.  For further information, see CL2HITS.DOC and CL2_CONV.DOC.

The accuracy of the energy calculation used is approxmiately 1.5% worst absolute
error for any channel, compared to the offline gain calibration available.

LIMITATIONS:
===========
    CAD bank(s) must be present.
    The present version does NOT correct ICD/MG energies fully.
    Initialization will take 1-2 minutes of CPU time on a 3100/38.
    

Some Relevant RCP file parameters: (default values are those listed below)
==================================
CAHITS:
    CAEP_ONLY   F       ! T will turn off comparison of PNUT1
    DO_GNSCOR   F       ! T will try to use DBL3 gain values
    DO_ZERO_SUPPESS T   ! F is preferable--CL2HITS does no zero suppression

CL2HITS:

    D0_DATA   TRUE      ! FALSE => NWA data (not supported yet)
    MONTE_CARLO TRUE    ! FALSE => real data
    SFTVSN 1            ! 2 for Series N Monte Carlo (i.e. most QCD background)
                        ! 1 for Monte Carlo BEFORE Series N
                                        (i.e. most of Grannis data)
                        ! 3 for data AFTER Series N Monte Carlo
                        ! 0 for the CURRENT (Freshly Generated) Monte Carlo
                        ! 0 for CURRENT DATA format
                        ! SFTVSN defined in CALORIMETER_ADDRESSING.MEM V2.02
CL2TEST:

! flags for initialization testing
 INI_TEST .FALSE.         ! histos about building CAGS and CADT
 PRINT_CADT  .FALSE.      ! be really sure--it's long
 PRINT_CAGS  .FALSE.      !
 DROP_GEOM  .FALSE.       ! drop geometry, like Jan will, and do final survey
! flags for HITS comparison
 TIME_HITS .TRUE.         ! timing tests per event
 COMPARE_HITS   T         ! want the ET comparison hit by hit?
                          ! will also compare MPT and SUMET 
                          !     if CAEP_ONLY = .FALSE.  (see CAHITS.RCP)
 CL2_DIFF_CUT  .015       ! channels with fraction ET error above this cut 
                          ! are printed to .OUT
                          !     (set to 10000. to kill printout)
! flags for candidates comparison
 TIME_CANDS .TRUE.        ! timing tests per candidate;
 TIMES_PER_CAND  1        ! number of times to repeat each event for timing
 COMPARE_CANDS .TRUE.     ! compare ET of candidates
 ICDJET  .TRUE.           ! convert ICD's as part of jet candidate
 SIZEM  1                 ! ring radius in TT around center
 SIZJT  3                 ! ring radius in TT around center
