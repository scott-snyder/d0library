                        Documentation on L2CRCAL: 
                        ( Level 2 Cosmic Ray Tool )



    I)  Introduction.
    This is intended to be a help document for using L2CRCAL, which is a
Level 2 Filtering tool. A more complete description of the role of a 
Level 2 Tool and how to set up a program builder program that to use such
tools in described more completely elsewhere. (D0$CALOR_FILTER:L2JETS.DOC,
D0$L2CONTROL:LEVEL2_MANUAL.MEM for example).
    Briefly, L2CRCAL is intended for the cosmic ray run. It takes results
from the level 2 muon track tool (from which it gets a track hit position
and directional cosines that point the track) and then a) calculates a 
list of cells that this ideal track would intersect in the CC. and b)
Clusters the energy around these cells. A zebra bank (CRCA) is filled
containing a list of 'hit' cells (in IETA,IPHI,ILYR offline coordinates)
as well as corresponding found energies.
    NOTE: L2CRCAL assumes some things in order to work:
    a) It only considers the central calorimeter as that is what it was
    intended for.
    b) It assumes that the muon points 'generally' in the direction of
    the beam pipe.  As of this writing, the cosmic ray commissioning run
    planned on triggering only on muons that passed through a scintillator
    that was located in the beam pipe region.
    c) It assumes that the muons have some transverse component. Naturally
    muons that have momentum primarily in the z direction cannot both
    trigger and intersect the calorimeter unless by some other interaction.
    L2CRCAL will not try to evaluate such tracks.

    II) How to run L2CRCAL with VMS_FILTER or in Level 2.
    The procedure for adding a tool has been described elsewhere (see
    the documents mentioned above for example).  L2CRCAL can be added
    in a similar way.  A  .INP file will be provided in D0$CALOR_FILTER
    which will allow users to easily add L2CRCAL to their list of tools
    while in TOOL_MAKER.

    III) L2CRCAL.RCP
    Like most tools, L2CRCAL has a corresponding RCP file that is needed
    for the tool_INIT phase of the running. This RCP file is pointed to
    by the logical: L2CRCAL_RCP.  This RCP file holds the various parameter
    sets under which this tool can be called. The individual parameters
    are as follows:
    
    MUON_TRACK_MODE INTEGER 
        This parameter is set either to 1 or to 0 and determines how the
    muon track direction is to be derived. 
    To take muon track from GEANT banks:
        0 : Take directional cosines from Muon Finder (normal mode)
        1 : Constrain track to pass through beam pipe.
    To take muon track from real muon finder (e.g. l2 muon finder)
        2 : take real track from MUOT
        3 : Constrain this track to pass through beampipe

    DPHI_CUT REAL
        This parameter fixes the maximum change in phi angle that the
    track is allowed to change. Ideally, if the track passes through the
    beam pipe, phi is a constant angle (except when it passes through the
    x=0,y=0 line when it changes by pi.  This cut is mainly a protection
    on an algorithm that depends to some extent on the track passing near
    the beampipe.

    IMUHIT_CONE  INTEGER
        This parameter fixes the radius of the cone used to cluster energy
    around the track.
        < 0     ---> No energy clustering is done
        = 0     ---> Just the cells where the track intersects the calorimeter
        = 1     ---> Also add the 8 nearest neighbors
        and so on....
