                        L2 ETSUM Filter
                

    The level 2 sum Et filter is based on a calculation of Sum Et
for all calorimeter channels not zero suppresssed by the hardware.
ICD/s and massless gaps are now included.  A correction is made for the vertex
position based on L2_VERT (currently slow L0 Z).  Thus, this calculation is
equivalent to the offline PNUT2 bank.  In addition, noisy channels are removed
by the ETMISS correction algorithm (set l2etmiss.doc)

    The current calculation assumes that the interaction vertex is at 0.

    The parameters for this filter are:

ETSUM_MIN      10.0            ! (Threshold) GeV minimum missing Et to pass.
ETOT_MAX      2400.0           ! Max total Energy allowed (to kill pileup)


    The cut can be assigned a maximum of 32 different values.

    This filter uses the CL2_xxxx unpacking routines.  This means it depends on
CL2HITS.RCP, CAHITS.RCP and CL2HITS.RCP; see CL2_CONV.DOC, and, for more on
CL2HITS.RCP, see CL2HITS.DOC.
