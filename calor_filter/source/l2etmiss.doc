                        L2 ETMISS Filter
                

    The level 2 missing Et filter is based on a calculation of missing Et
for all calorimeter channels not zero suppresssed by the hardware.
ICD/s and massless gaps are now included.  A correction is made for the vertex
position based on L2_VERT (currently slow L0 Z).  Thus, this calculation is
equivalent to the offline PNUT2 bank.  
     In addition, a correction algorithm is applied to recognize noisy cells.
Presently it looks for the highest Et cell in the event, and deletes it if it is
isolated in the sense that it has little energy in neighboring depth layers in
the same tower.

    The only parameter for this filter is the threshold:

ETMISS_MIN      10.0            !GeV minimum missing Et to pass.

    The cut can be assigned a maximum of 32 different values.

    This filter uses the CL2_xxxx unpacking routines.  This means it depends on
CL2HITS.RCP, CAHITS.RCP and CL2HITS.RCP; see CL2_CONV.DOC, and, for more on
CL2HITS.RCP, see CL2HITS.DOC.
