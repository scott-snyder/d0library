    Documentation for Online Monitoring of the L2_EM Filter Tool via EXAMINE
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:
------------
    The L2EM_HIST routine called by the L2_CHECK EXAMINE makes histograms
of various cut variables used for making pass/fail decisions in the L2_EM
online data aquisition filter.  It is controlled by the L2EM_HIST.RCP file.
Various parameters are supplied in L2EM_HIST.RCP which provide selection
criteria for the user (global monitor?) to control what actually gets put into
the histograms booked and filled by L2EM_HIST.

THINGS TO BE AWARE OF:
----------------------
    The D0 online environment has several features which make understanding
the information provided by online EXAMINE software (and consequently monitoring
the experiment) somewhat difficult.  The only data EXAMINE has available to it
when used in DAQ mode is what is contained in global shared common.  The data
in global shared common must pass some trigger/filter combination in order to
get to this buffer.  

    The information plotted by L2EM_HIST is gotten from L2EM banks which are
filled online in the Level 2 nodes.  The L2EM banks contain cut variable 
information for all Level 1 EM candidates for all parameter sets.  This means
each event has a linear chain of L2EM banks of length 
L = (# L1 candidates) * (# L2_EM parameter sets).  Since list building is done
in Level 1, this can be quite a large number of banks since these banks are 
filled regardless of whether or not any candidates pass the L2_EM filter.  The 
number of L2_EM parameter sets is determined by the filter scripts contained in 
the trigger configuration files.  The filter scripts are parsed by COOR and the 
corresponding parameters are downloaded to the Level 2 nodes.

    The L2_EM filter tool knows nothing about filter bit numbers.  The only 
information L2_EM has regarding decision criteria are the parameter set numbers
distributed by COOR and the parameters which belong to each set.  Consequently
the only information in the L2EM banks regarding which filter bit the L2_EM
tool was called for is the parameter set number from COOR.  This makes 
referencing the information in the L2EM bank by filter bit difficult.

    There is a one to one correspondence between filter bit and parameter set
for each run, but this mapping may change depending upon which trigger
configuration file is downloaded.  The filter bit to parameter set mapping 
changes if more or fewer filter scripts which use the L2_EM tool are contained
in one configuration file than another, or if the ordering of the filter bits
change.  The D0 triggermeisters try to avoid this but sometimes it is 
impossible (i.e. if a new filter is added). 

    Since global shared common only contains events which pass a filter, all
information about events which fail all filters is lost (except in mark and 
pass mode).  Therefore THE EVENT RATES MUST BE MONITORED.  Some information 
about events which fail all filter scripts that call the L2_EM tool can be 
gotten from events which pass other independent filters, however this
information may be somewhat biased.  THE MOST IMPORTANT HISTOGRAM MADE IS THE
L2_EM IFAILED CODES HISTOGRAM.  THE BINS OF THIS HISTOGRAM SHOULD BE
APPROXIMATELY THE SAME HEIGHT RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER FROM RUN TO RUN.  The
IFAILED codes from L2_EM tell one where the candidate failed in the code
(i.e. which cut).  The IFAILED codes are:

    CODE  TRANSLATION
    ----  -----------
      0 = PASS
      1 = ET
      2 = UNPACKING PROBLEM OR NO CANDIDATE FOR THIS PARAMETER SET
      3 = SUM OF EM LAYERS ET (SUMEM) IS ZERO OR NEGATIVE
     10 = FH1/SUMEM HIGH SIDE
     11 = EM1/SUMEM LOW SIDE
     12 = EM1/SUMEM HIGH SIDE
     13 = (EM1+EM2)/SUMEM LOW SIDE
     14 = (EM1+EM2)/SUMEM HIGH SIDE
     15 = EM3/SUMEM LOW SIDE
     16 = EM3/SUMEM HIGH SIDE
     17 = EM4/SUMEM LOW SIDE
     18 = EM4/SUMEM HIGH SIDE
     52 = 3X3 SUM OF EM3 CELLS AROUND HOT EM3 CELL IS ZERO OR NEGATIVE
     53 = EM3 (5X5-3X3)/3X3 CC HIGH SIDE
     54 = EM3 (5X5-3X3)/3X3 EC HIGH SIDE
     55 = 5X5 SUM OF EM3 CELLS AROUND HOT EM3 CELL IS ZERO OR NEGATIVE
     56 = EM3 (7X7-5X5)/5X5 (IETA>31 ONLY) HIGH SIDE
     57 = EM3 (4X4-2X2)/2X2 CC HIGH SIDE
     58 = EM3 1X1/3X3 CC LOW SIDE
     59 = SIGMA3-MID CC TWO SIDED BUT SYMMETRIC
     60 = SIGMA5 HIGH SIDE
     61 = SIGMA5-SIGMA3 HIGH SIDE
     70 = ISOLATION (CONE-CORE)/CORE HIGH SIDE
    100 = NO TRACK
    101 = TRACK VETO
    666 = TRIGGER WHERE NO TRIGGER INSTRUMENTATION OR EM CALORIMETER EXISTS
          (LOOK AT OVERFLOWS ON HISTOGRAM)

THESE CODES SHOULD ESPECIALLY BE CHECKED WHEN A NEW LEVEL2 SOFTWARE RELEASE HAS
RECENTLY BEEN MADE.  BUGS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW UP HERE OR IN THE PASS RATES. BOTH
SHOULD BE CAREFULLY MONITORED.


L2EM_HIST CONTROLS:
-------------------
    The L2EM_HIST routine makes the following histograms available:

 ID         Title
-----      -------
 1          L2_EM IETA
 2          L2_EM IPHI
 3          L2_EM eta of shower center
 4          L2_EM vertex corrected eta of shower center

 6          L2_EM ET (VTX=0)
 7          L2_EM ET (ZCORR)
 8          L2_EM ET (ZCORR) - ET (VTX=0)

 20         L2_EM (CONE-CORE)/CORE (isolation)
 21         L2_EM number of tracks in road (CC only)
 22         L2_EM IFAILED CODES
 23         L2_EM IFAILED CODES (ALL)

The histogram titles reflect the fact that some cut variables are only used in 
some regions of the D0 detector.

    THE 'L2_EM IFAILED CODES (ALL)' HISTOGRAM CANNOT BE TURNED OFF.  IT IS NOT 
AFFECTED BY THE FOLLOWING SWITCHES, AND IS FILLED FOR EVERY CANDIDATE FOR EVERY 
PARAMETER SET FOR EVERY EVENT THAT MAKES IT TO GLOBAL SHARED COMMON.  IT IS NOT
REDUNDANT WITH THE OTHER 'L2_EM IFAILED CODES' HISTOGRAM.

In addition to turning histograms on or off, there are several other controls.
These are:

    ALL         LOGICAL
    HI_ET       LOGICAL
    PASS_TRIG   LOGICAL
    PASS_FILT   LOGICAL
    PASS_CAND   LOGICAL
    FILT_ONLY   LOGICAL
    NTRIG       INTEGER
    NFILT       INTEGER
    TRIG        CHARACTER ARRAY
    FILT        CHARACTER ARRAY
    HIST_ON     LOGICAL ARRAY
    HIST_PARM   REAL ARRAY 2-D
    FILT_TABLE  CHARACTER ARRAY

    ALL - If this switch is TRUE all candidates for all parameter sets will
    be plotted in all histograms.  It is redundant with setting all other
    logical flags to false, but it should be used instead since it bypasses
    the decision making code and will speed up processing.

    HI_ET - If this switch is TRUE only the highest Et candidates will be 
    plotted.

    PASS_TRIG - If this switch is TRUE, the event will be checked to ensure
    that the Level 1 trigger name specified in the TRIG array passed.

    PASS_FILT - If this switch is TRUE, the event will be checked to ensure
    that the Level 2 filter name specified in the FILT array passed.

    PASS_CAND - Only candidates which pass the L2_EM filter tool will be
    plotted.

    FILT_ONLY - Only plot candidates for filters specified in the FILT array.

    NTRIG - The number of triggers the user wants to be checked.  Must be equal 
    to the number of names given in the TRIG array.

    NFILT - The number of filters the user wants to be checked.  Must be equal
    to the number of names given in the FILT array.

    TRIG - An array of character strings containing the names of the triggers
    the user wants to be checked.  Names can be partial, i.e. 'EM*' will check
    that any trigger beginning with EM fired. Wild card (*) usage is limited.  
    Wild cards may only be used at the end of a string.  For example,
    'EM*' is legal, but '*2*' or '*MAX' are not for compatibilty reasons
    with other D0 software such as L1NAME_PASSED.  DO NOT INCLUDE THE LUMINOSITY
    SUFFIX IN THE TRIGGER NAME.

    FILT - An array of character strings containing the names of the filters
    the user wants to be checked.  Names can be partial, i.e. 'GAM*' will check
    that any filter beginning with 'GAM' passed.  Wild card (*) usage is 
    limited. Wild cards may only be used at the end of a string.  For example,
    'ELE*' is legal, but '*MAX*' or '*_SG' are not for compatibilty reasons
    with other D0 software such as L2NAME_PASSED. DO NOT INCLUDE THE LUMINOSITY 
    SUFFIX IN THE FILTER NAME.

    HIST_ON - A logical array to turn histograms on or off.  TRUE = ON.

    HIST_PARM - A real array containing the booking parameters for histograms. 

    FILT_TABLE - Character array containing the parameter set to filter bit
    mapping from COOR for all EM triggers.  This array is used internally by
    L2EM_HIST to determine the correspondence between parameter set and filter
    bit.  The array index corresponds to the parameter set number, and the
    character string contents correspond to the filter bit name.  This table
    can be checked by comparing it to the list in LEVEL2.INFO produced by
    COOR when a configuration file is downloaded.  The L2_EM tool number is 17.
    It should not be necessary to modify or check this array unless a new 
    configuration file is downloaded which has the number or order of filter
    bits changed.  WHEN MODIFYING THE FILTER NAMES IN THIS ARRAY DO NOT 
    INCLUDE THE LUMINOSITY SUFFIX.


USAGE:
    All logical switches may be combined.  The ALL switch overrides all other
switches except PASS_CAND.  An example combination would be to set all switches 
except ALL to true (ALL should be set to false in this example) and specify the 
names of some (one or more) trigger(s) in the TRIG array and filter(s) in the 
FILT array.  As mentioned previously, partial trigger/filter names may be used 
to select several filters (i.e. 'ELE').  The result of this set of parameters
would be to fill histograms only for the highest Et candidates which passed the
L2_EM tool and which had the trigger and filter bits set for the triggers and 
filters specified in the TRIG and FILT arrays and only for those parameter sets 
corresponding to the filters specified in the FILT array.

    Persons doing special runs should not use FILT_ONLY unless they make their 
own version of L2EM_HIST.RCP which has a modified FILT_TABLE array that 
reflects the parameter set to filter bit mapping used in their trigger 
configuration file.  This routine was designed for global runs.

TO RETURN TO THE METHOD OF FILLING USED BEFORE THIS UPGRADE SET THE SWITCHES 
AS FOLLOWS:

    ALL         T
    HI_ET       F
    PASS_TRIG   F
    PASS_FILT   F
    PASS_CAND   T
    FILT_ONLY   F

This setup will fill histograms with all candidates which pass the L2_EM tool
for all parameter sets regardless of trigger or filter decision.  The contents 
of the FILT and TRIG arrays are ignored.  If the changes to the trigger 
configuration files become too frequent it may be best to just use this setup.

    The FILT_TABLE array may occaisonally (I hope) need to be modified if major 
changes to the global run trigger configuration files are made.  This should be
infrequent.  The document included below gives instructions about where to get
this information.  The FILT_TABLE array in L2EM_HIST.RCP has the following
format.  The array index corresponds to the parameter set number, and the
contents of the array for a given index contains the name of the filter bit 
which corresponds to that parameter set number.  ONE SHOULD NOT INCLUDE THE
LUMINOSITY SUFFIXES WHEN MODIFYING THE NAMES IN THE FILT_TABLE ARRAY.

            Filter Bit to Parameter Set Mapping Table for V6.5-L10
            ------------------------------------------------------

 Notes
 -----
    To get the filter bit to parameter set map from COOR one can look at two
    files produced by COOR when the trigger configuration is downloaded.  The
    files are TRIG_FILT_RUN.INFO and LEVEL_2.INFO.  These files reside in the
    ONLINE:[COOR_EXEC] area on D0.  The most recent versions of the files 
    correspond to the most recent download that was done.  The LEVEL_2.INFO
    file contains the Filter #, Tool #, Parameter Set # list for all filter
    scripts for the download.  The TRIG_FILT_RUN.INFO file contains the bit
    numbers and Trigger/Filter names for the configuration and also has the
    correspondence between trigger and filter bits.  The table below was 
    constructed from these two files for V6.5-L10.  I believe the filter bit to 
    parameter set mapping is valid for all luminosities even though the filter 
    names change, but I am not sure of this.

    Filter # = Filter bit # + 1  (Filter #'s = 1-128, Filter bit #'s = 0-127)

    Tool number for L2_EM tool is 17.  

    The format of the Filter lines are:

    Filter [#] [Tool #] [<-Parameter set #] [Tool #] [<-Parameter Set #] ...

    Example

An alternative (and significantly simpler) method of getting the filter bit
to parameter set mapping is to run the Level 2 simulator (VMS_FILTER) on an
event and look at the FILTER REPORT.  This requires that one have trigger
configuration files that work with COOR_SIM however.  Getting these
configuration files is not too difficult if one starts with the online TRIGPARSE
files contained in the CFG area.  One can modify the TRIGPARSE file and remove
all the online specific keywords and then simply run TRIGPARSE and COOR_SIM to
generate the necessary files for VMS_FILTER and then run the production version
of VMS_FILTER on 1 or 2 events.
