                        CAHITS_L2 Package

    The purpose of this package is to substitute the results of the CAHITS
package for those of the CL2 unpacking package.  This allows testing of the
effects of zero supression and/or pedestal subtraction on the calorimeter level
2 filters, and, in the case of the electron filter, comparison of the results of
using CAEP banks filled with E or with Et.  The L2 PNUT bank is replaced with
PNUT1, the bank with no ICD/MG corrections.  If E is chosen, the jets filter
will also see E instead of Et in the CAEP bank, but will take no action to
respond to this fact.

Dependencies
------------
    Run AFTER CALOR package.

    Run between CAHITS and VMS_FILTER; if CAEP CAEH and PNUT banks already
there, CAHITS can be dispensed with.  
    
    CAHITS_L2 is compatible with the RERUN_L12 package; preferably put in the
order RERUN_L12, CAHITS_L2, but I do not believe the detailed order matters.

Usage
-----
    To use the CAHITS_L2 package, put it in the package list after CAHITS and
before VMS_FILTER.

Parameters
----------
    The CAHITS_L2 rcp file contains the parameter

ET_IN_CAEP  

    which controls whether the level 2 CAEP bank (under the FILT path)
is filled with E or with Et

    Relevant parameters in CAHITS control the inputs:
* the zero supression settings allow experimentation with Zero supression (For
speed reasons, the CL2 unpacking uses the zero supression provided by the
hardware).  Thus, do_zero_supress = .false. is for now closest to the present
behavior of CL2; .true. with say 1.5 sigma would be closer to reality, were
there any values for sigma in DBL3 for monte carlo data; presently there are
none.

* the variable MONTE_CARLO_DATA controls whether the vertex is used in
  calculating Et.  CL2 unpacking assumes z = 0, so .FALSE. gives results most
  like CL2.
