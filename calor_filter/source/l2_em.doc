                            Filter Scripts
                            --------------

As an example, here is the filter script for the ELE_2_MAX filter used in Run 1A
to trigger on 2 isolated EM candidates both with Et>20 GeV and which passed the
primary  electron shape cuts.

                        The L2_EM Algorithm 
                        -------------------

    This algorithm description explains ALL the possible cuts.  All the cuts are
done if the E_TIGHT parameter option is selected.  But generally all cuts have
not been used in the past, neither for electrons nor for photons.  Cut values
not specified directly as tool parameters come from D0$LEVEL2$L2SIM:L2_EM.RCP,
which is downloaded as an STP file to level 2.

1)    Find candidate(s) from level 1
2)    Find peak EM3 cell in a trigger tower which triggers at Level 1
3)    Unpack EM + FH1 energy in 3X3 readout towers around peak EM3 cell
4)    Find centroid of shower
5)    Get vertex z position
6)    Correct Et for vertex position and leakage out of nominal cluster size.
7)    Cut on Level 2 EM Et
8)    Cut on longitudinal shape
9)    Cut on transverse shape
10)   Cut on track match 
11)   Cut on isolation of candidate 
    
The peak EM3 cell is the one with the largest single EM3 deposit inside the
original candidate trigger tower.


Longitudinal Algorithm 
----------------------
The cuts are divided into two groups: primary and secondary.  The primary
cuts are FH1/SUMEM and EM3/SUMEM (f5 and f3 below) and are used unless the
SHAPE_CUTS field in the filter script is set to IGNORE.  The 
secondary cuts are not used unless the E_TIGHT option is selected in 
the filter script SHAPE_CUTS field.  For the P_TIGHT or PHOTON options
f1 and f2 below are not done.

    The tested region for the longitudinal algorithm is 3X3 readout towers
around the readout tower containing the peak EM3 cell.  This size is independent
of eta.  This 3x3 region is also the core region used in the cone isolation
algorithm.
    
Floor fractions f(i) = E(i)/SUMEM, i = 1-5 are calculated.  SUMEM is the sum of
the first 4 floors.  However, only FH1 participates in floor 5. 

The cuts are made on f5, f3, f1, (f1+f2), f4 (in that order)

    [NOTE: because of the offset introduced in the energy scale, the f1 and
f1+f2 cuts are NO LONGER PERFORMED EVEN FOR E_TIGHT]

There are lower and upper cuts on f1-f4.  f5 has only an upper side cut
performed on it.  However the low side cuts on f1,f2,f4 are turned off in the
RCP file at this writing.  All longitudinal cuts depend on both energy and
eta.  Presently the f3 cuts are quite loose, so that they effectively only serve
to eliminate "hot" single cells in the EM layers which trigger.


Transverse Algorithm 
--------------------
The primary cuts are:

    CC: S5-S3 (99% efficient value from TB data)
    EC(IETA < 31): dE5X5/E3X3 (99% efficient value from TB data)
    EC(IETA = 31,32): dE7X7/E3X3 (100% efficient value from Yi Xia)

The other cuts are used only in the E_TIGHT option of the SHAPE_CUTS filter
script parameter.  Some of the cuts described below are turned off even if
the TIGHT option is selected.  


ietac   MAX/3X3 S3  dE5X5/E3X3 S5  S5-S3  dE4X4/E2X2 dE7X7/E5X5
1-12       x     x      x       x    x       x
13      no EM calorimeter, so no EM triggers here.
14-25                   x            x        
26-30                   x            x           
31-32                                                     x          
33-37   candidate automatically fails (no trigger here now).

    This diagram shows what cuts the L2_EM filter tool will attempt under the
E_TIGHT option, however if the cut values are set very  large in the RCP file
which contains the cut values, it is as if no cut was  made.
The *'s in the descriptions below mark those cuts which are turned off in the
RCP at this writing.

Definitions:

*MAX/3X3 .GE. cut value (no E, eta dependence!), turned off in RCP file.
    
*S3 
    cut is on lo < S3 < hi, where

            lo, hi = -(A2*peak**2 + B1*peak + C0) - or + Delta
                    (peak) is the energy in the peak EM3 cell  

    turned off in RCP file.
    S3, S5 are defined as energy-weighted <r> (NOT rms)  
        with units if EM3 cells

E5X5, E3X3 are the energy sums in 5X5 and 3X3 EM3 cell regions about the peak.

dE5X5/E3X3
    cut on (E5X5 - E3X3) / E3X3, primary in EC, secondary in CC, SUMEM
    and IETAC dependent.

*S5
    the cut is on S5 < max, INDEPENDENT of energy, eta

S5-S3
    The cut is on S5-S3 < cut depending on SUMEM, IETAC, primary in CC, 
    secondary in EC (turned off in RCP above IETA=25).

dE4X4/E2X2 CC, *EC
    From peak EM3 cell, find eta, phi neighbors with highest energies.  Build
a 2X2 EM3 array including these 3 and the cell which fills out the 2X2 square.
Then make a surrounding 4X4 cell square.  Call the energies in these
two E2X2 and E4X4.  Seconary only in CC.  Not done in EC, turned off in RCP.

    min < (E4X4 - E2X2) / E2X2 < max, where min, max indep of energy

dE7X7/E5X5

    cut on (E7X7 - E5X5) / E5X5 < max independent of energy
                                  since far forward will always be high E if
                                  candidate passes Et threshold, IETA=31,32
                                                        
Cone Algorithm
--------------
    The core is a sum over the layers selected in D0$LEVEL2$L2SIM:L2_EM.RCP:
Core sums from LO_GAMMA_FLOOR to HI_GAMMA_FLOOR (as of run 1A, EM 1-4), over the
3 x 3 Readout Towers centered about the highest EM3 cell.
    The cone is a sum over LO_CONE_LAYER to HI_CONE_LAYER, with possibly the
ICD/MG  turned off by CONE_USE_ICD (as of run 1A, the sum is over all layers
except the ICD/MG).  The lateral extent is chosen by the CONE_DELTA_R parameter
for the script: cells with centers that close to the central readout tower are
included. 



                Energy And Eta Dependence Of Cuts
                ---------------------------------

Energies are broken up into 4 ranges:

                L (1)  < ETH1  
      ETH1 <    M (2)  < ETH2  
      ETH2 <    H (3)  < ETH3  
      ETH3 <    X (4)

    The L,M,H,X notation is used below in the description of RCP contents.

The actual energy boundaries ETH1,ETH2,ETH3 are different for CC and EC:

                   CC          EC

ETH1            14.0 GeV    29.0 GeV
ETH2            35.0 GeV    70.0 GeV
ETH3            65.0 GeV   150.0 GeV


There are 8 eta regions:
    
                |IETAC|   L2_EM eta region
                -------   ----------------
                 1-2      CC index  1   
                 3-6      CC        2
                 7-12     CC        3
                  13        no EM so no shape cuts performed
                14-15     EC        5
                16-18     EC        6
                19-24     EC        7
                25-31     EC        8
                32-37       no shape cuts performed

    These indices are used below in the description of RCP bank contents.


                            Cut Tuning
                            ----------
    This information is taken mostly from the header of 
D0$LEVEL2$L2SIM:L2_EM_TB05.RCP.  A more detailed D0 note is in preparation.

   Cuts used:
    The 99% point is defined as that cut value which passes 99% of the test
sample (TB for data, MC for Monte Carlo).  The "100 %" point is defined a little
differently, and its precise meaning varies but is described below.
    
PRIMARY CUTS:
 EM3       cuts set to .1 .9 (lo hi)
 FH1       cuts set to 1.5*99% value
 SIGMA5-SIGMA3 or 5X5-3X3 as main
       cuts set to 99% value (after TB selection cuts!!)
       For very LOW energy electrons (less than 10 GeV)
       the efficiency of these cuts is reduced due to changes in
       longitudinal shower profile.  At 5 GeV these cuts are approximately
       95% efficient, decreasing with decreasing energy.
       for IETAC=31,32 use Yi Xia's value of cut on 7x7-5x5


 SECONDARY CUTS:
    chosen at "100%" efficiency point defined as follows
       EC: "100%" = 99%(actual) * 1.25
           added cuts for the EC:
           EM1(high), EM12(high),EM4(low, high), and SIGMA5-SIGMA3
                                                       (for ieta<26)
           as secondary transverse variables regions where not already cut on

       CC: 100% = 99% + (99%-90%)
           added cuts for the CC:
           EM1(high), EM1+2(high),EM4(high), 4x4-2x2/2x2 and 5X5-3X3/3X3
           as secondary transverse variables in regions where these variables
           are not already cut on

*** Description of L2_EM filter shower shape cuts from load 1 ECEM data ***

 Load 1 Test Beam analysis done by Peter Grudberg

 DATA USED:

     Ntuples of the L2_EM cut variables were made (old CAHITS, but sampling
 fractions used by TB90_CALOR_UNPACK have been changed to match the new CAHITS)
 on one eta scan and two energy scans.  Zero suppression was applied in
 software at the 2 sigma level.

     ETA scan: (ECEM eta scan # 2)
         ENERGY = 100 GeV
         ETA = 1.55, 1.65, 1.75, 1.85, 1.95, 2.05, 2.25, 2.55, 2.65, 2.86, 3.05
         PHI = 61

     ENERGY scan # 1 (ECEM E scan # 5)
         ENERGY = 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 GeV
        ETA = 1.95
         PHI = 61

     ENERGY scan # 2 (ECEM E scan # 7)
         ENERGY = 25, 50, 100, 150
         ETA = 2.55
         PHI = 61

 Note: For one run, the new version of the ntuple package was used (new
 CAHITS),  and the results were the same as for the old package with correct
 sampling fractions.

     ANALYSIS:

 Tables of efficiency vs cut value for all L2_EM variables were made from
 the  ntuples using PAW macros written by Mike Tartaglia (with small
 modifications).  Several tables for each variable/ntuple combination were
 made, in order to study the effects of several technical cuts and try to get a
 clean electron sample.  The technical cuts tried were:

     TRK: at least on PWC track in all views
     CRY: 1.le.ncryox.le.4 .and. 1.le.ncryoy.le.4
           (ie, require not too many hits in cryo pwcs)
     ETA: Require ieta of max EM3 tower (L2_ETA) equal to selected ieta
           (some runs cover more than one ieta tower, depending on pad size)
     PHI: Require iphi of max EM3 tower (L2_PHI) equal to 31 (benchmark phi)
     TAG: BIT 5,6 and 8 in TAG_WORD set (cerenkov bits)

 The combinations tried were:
     NOCUTS, CRY+ETA, TRK+CRY+ETA, CRY+ETA+TAG, CRY+ETA+PHI, CRY+ETA+PHI+TAG

     The combination used was CRY+ETA+PHI, which seemed to give the best
 signal/noise (further cuts seemed to just reduce the statistics without
 significant cleaning of the signal).  For one run (E=125, ETA=1.95),
 CRY+ETA+TAG+PHI was used, as there seemed to be unusually large pion
 contamination (confirmed by private communication with A. Spadafora).

     The energy and eta dependence of the four primary cuts was parametrized
 for each efficiency  value using simple functions based on the data in the
 efficiency tables.   The cut values for FH1(high) and 5x5-3x3(high) were
 obtained using these parametrizations   For each bin in (energy,eta), the
 least restrictive point of the parametrization was used.   For the FH1 cut,
 the numbers below are 1.5 times the 99% parametrization value; for the
 5X5-3X3 cut,  an additional safety factor of 0.25% ! was added (ie, the
 numbers below are 99%+0.25(99%-98%)).


*** Description of L2_EM filter shower shape cuts from Load 2 CCEM data ***

  Load 2 Test Beam Analysis done by Mirek Fatyga

 1. Require a good track (one track upstream of the bending magnet, one track
    downstream of the bending magnet).

 2. Require that the calculated beam momentum is within 20% of the nominal
    value.

 3. Require at least one upstream cerenkov.

 4. No hits closer than (approx.) 2cm from the CCEM crack.


 ADDITIONAL TESTS PERFORMED:

 -  require one and only one cluster in each plane of the cryo-pwc.
    NO EFFECT ON RESULTS

 -  veto on mip and muon counters
    NO EFFECT ON RESULTS


 DATA SETS USED:

- Three fine energy scans in the 7.5 - 100GeV energy range.
   eta = 0.05, 0.45, 1.05
   phi = 31.6 (corresponding to the benchmark point. approx. 4.5cm from the
               CCEM crack)

 - Energy dependence of cut limits obtained at three eta values on the basis
   of these three energy scans. Simple functional fits to energy dependence
   were obtained at each eta. Linear interpolation of fit parameters was used
   to set limits in prescribed (eta x energy) bins.
 -  NOTE: The typical test beam run does not iluminate the calorimeter
    surface uniformly. Potentially, this can cause an error in the
    determination of transverse cuts (based on transverse energy sharing).
    To assess this error we analyzed two sets of runs which were taken to
    study the position resolution in the CC. In these sets, one readout
    tower (eta=0.05, eta=0.55) was carefuly scanned with the beam (both in
    eta and phi) to effectively create a uniform ilumination of a single
    readout tower. We analyzed these runs in the same manner as the three
    energy scans used to establish cut values. We then compared all results,
    searching for significant deviations due to the change in the position of
    the beam. Based on this analysis, we believe that the error on
    sigma5-sigma3 is no larger than 2% off the nominal efficiency value.
    A similar argument can be made concerning the influence of vertex
    smearing on longitudinal cuts. We analyzed a set of test beam runs which
    were dedicated to the scanning of the vertex position. Using the same
    principle, we conclude that the vertex smearing does not introduce
    significant errors in our cuts. IN ADDITION, all longitudinal cuts
    were opened beyond their 99% values to increase the safety margin.
    We found that most of these cuts can be opened without damaging
    the background rejection in a significant way.

 -  NOTE: The cuts are based on test beam data. No effect of
    an underlying event, pileup, etc. were taken into account.

    This diagram shows what cuts the L2_EM filter tool will attempt under the
E_TIGHT option, however if the cut values are set very  large in the RCP file
which contains the cut values, it is as if no cut was  made (see *'s below for
those turned off in RCP at this writing).*

All the RCP cut arrays below get mapped into the L2_EM internal array
EMCUTS(j,i,x), where x=1,2,3,4=L,M,H,X below and the IETA index is as described
in the energy and eta binning description section.

RCP cut arrays:
    ELCxi(j)  x = L,M,H,X  energy index
              i = eta index for CC: 1,2,3 table above gives ranges.
              j = cut number:

Basic Geometry (from Calorimeter_addressing.mem)
------------------------------------------------

    The convention is as follows:
    1   EM1                     (MNLYEM = 1)
    2   EM2
    3   EM3a
    4   EM3b
    5   EM3c
    6   EM3d
    7   EM4                     (MXLYEM = 7)
    8   CC Massless gap         (MNLYMG = 8)
    9   ICD
    10  EC Massless gap         (MXLYMG = 10)
    11  FH1 (Fine Hadronic)     (MNLYFH = 11)
    12  FH2
    13  FH3
    14  FH4                     (MXLYFH = 14)
    15  CH1 (Coarse Hadronic)   (MNLYCH = 15)
    16  CH2
    17  CH3                     (MXLYCH = 17)


        The definition of the EM3 sublayer order is:
                
                ^
                | EM3b | EM3d
                |  4   |  6        i.e. EM3d is LAYERC = 6
    increasing  | ----------- 
       phi      | EM3a | EM3c
                |  3   |  5
                --------------->
                  increasing z (increasing eta) 

                That is, the SAME orientation is used in all parts of the
            calorimeter, with respect to the phi and +z directions.  
            The EM3 layer is indexed effectively with sub-indices in the
            phi and eta directions, with phi running fastest.

    An auxiliary system is also sometimes used, substituting a different
coordinate, FLOOR,  for the depth dimension, and summing all the EM3 signals
into a single floor.  That is

        FLOOR   LAYERC
        1       1       EM1
        2       2       EM2
        3       3,4,5,6 EM3
        4       7       EM4
        5       8-14    FH + MG + ICD
