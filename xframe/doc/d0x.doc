  This   program is  intended  to be  a  fully  X/Motif  browser  and Zebra
 navigator. It is  meant to allow you  to read in a  file (FZ or STP, RZ is
 not yet  implemented) and take a  look around indside  the Zebra structure
 using "point and click" operations. Standard X-windows libraries are used,
 so you can run this in  client-server mode as  you wish. All functions are
 explained via online HELP. The code has been tested and works on the SGI
 and IBM unix platforms.  

 The program provides help buttons, the following is from the main help:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The program is intended to be a  'mini-frame' to allow fast access to data
 files and STP files without having to relink a D0USER or CALOR_OFF or etc.
 program.  The  following  menus  contain  controls for   commands, and are
 available as buttons in the MAIN window:

             File            -    allows  opening and  closing of Zebra,
                                  STP,or OUTPUT files
             Control         -    controls reading in records, skipping,
                                  and searching
             Zebra Utilities -    allows access to Zebra debugging util-
                                  ities (e.g. DZSURV, etc.)
             D0 Utilities    -    allows access to various  D0 debugging
                                  utilities (e.g. DBANK, etc.)
                                                                                
In addition, there are two buttons in the menu bar:

 Exit            - Exit the program
 Output_Event    - Allows you to write the events which is currently in
                   memory to a file (in either exchange or native mode)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Additional windows  (entered by clicking on the  appropriate button in the
 D0 UTILITIES window):

 o NAVIGATOR:  the  "navigator"  allows  you to  navigate  around the Zebra
   array, very  useful for  interactive  debugging. It will  work on either
   ZEBCOM or  ZEBSTP (with  GEANT and ZEBWRK  as well but  this hasn't been
   thoroughly tested).

 o RAW DATA BROWSER: this window  alows you to look at a raw data bank (one
   of the 8 crate data) in a format  which "understands" what a "crate" is.
   Again, this is useful for debugging.

 The program exists in D0$XFRAME area.  To setup, you do the usual:

 $ D0SETUP XFRAME

 and to invoke the executable, you do

 $ D0X
