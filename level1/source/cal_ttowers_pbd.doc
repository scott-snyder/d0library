    The   program   builder   package   CAL_TTOWERS   fills  the  bank CTTR
(calorimeter trigger towers)  starting from a CAEP bank. It consists of the
following interfaces:

o CTTR_INI     initialization of array indicating which towers are on

o CAL_TTOWERS  event processing, books and fills CTTR bank

o CTTR_DMP     dump CTTR bank 
               has entry point CTTR_DEFD to turn on/off dump

o CTTR_DIAL    interactive dialog (via COMPACK):
               turn on/off smearing and reset cutoff 
               The defaults are:
               Add noise
               Do resolution smearing (now set to 4% constant term)
               Et cutoff> 1.0 GeV


CAL_TTOWERS calls:
  CTTRFL     to fill CTTR
  CTTR_SMEAR to smear information
  CTTR_ANL   to fill sample histograms in directory CTTR       


A file CAL_TTOWERS.PBD exists in D0$D0USER to run this package in the
D0USER framework. The size of ZEBCOM required depends on the input file
CTTR itself needs typically only 1000 words or less (depending on the Et 
cutoff). A combined package of interest for level1 studies is ISA_CAEP
plus CAL_TTOWERS, this makes it possible to do trigger studies using
the FAKE montecarlo. To make such a combined package you need:

$ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/NAME=FAKE_TRIGGERS

to get all files required for a FAKE_TRIGGERS_D0USER.

User can modify CTTR_ANL to do his own histogramming or add his own
package to the list in FAKE_TRIGGERS_COMBINED_PACKAGES.PBD.
