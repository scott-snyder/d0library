                        DZSURV_ZEBCOM   

                        DZSURV_ZEBSTP

    These are two releated utilities to help debugging.

    Like DBANK, they are meant to be used via a CALL statement in the
debugger:
    
DEBUG>    CALL DZSURV_ZEBCOM

    These routines 
        call dzsurv  (which writes out the number and size of all banks found)
    and call dzveri  which verifies the integrity of the zebra structure

    DZSURV_ZEBCOM performs this for ZEBCOM, and DZSURV_ZEBSTP performs this
for ZEBSTP.

    The results of the verification are reported on the screen.

    In order to see the results of the survey, the file FOR003.DAT is
    closed and reopened.  You are prompted for the window of opportunity in
    which you can peek at the results (presumably in another window).
