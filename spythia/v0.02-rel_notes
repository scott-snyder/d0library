 25-JAN-1996 : Modifications released by Adam L. Lyon
 
    - Added ULALPS_SUSY that runs alpha s with SUSY effects included.  User
      can turn this feature on or off (default is off) with the RCP file.

    - Fixed linking problems on SGI.

    - Spythia now makes its output in exchange mode.

    - Spythia no longer loses track of the run number and the event numbers are
      now sequential.
