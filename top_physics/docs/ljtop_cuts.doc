    The LJTOP_CUTS package uses standards cuts to analyze the top to lepton +
jets  channel.  The  analysis  assumes  the  events has  two top  jets both
decaying to W + b-jet with one of  the W's decaying to e or mu + nu and the
other to 2 jets. 

    A basic assumption is that the  missing Et is dominated by the neutrino
coming from W leptonic decay, it is then used to calculate the pz of the W.
There are 2 solutions, it is assumed that the more central solution (lowest
absolute pz) is  the correct one.  This happens to be  true over 70% of the
time and in those cases when the wrong one is picked the two solutions tend
to be closed together.

The jets are ordered in descending Et, another assumption is that the first
4 jets are the ones coming from top jets.

There are three  algorithms  available to assign jets  to the various decay
channels:

1) Assume the jet closest to the W  decaying leptonically is the associated
   b-jet  from the  first top  decay.  Assume  any  leftover jets  (up to 3
   highest ET ones)  are from the  second top. Assume  the pair giving mass
   closest to W mass are the jets from W -> jets (if there is more than one
   pair available).

2) Require at least 4 jets and use  the 4 with highest ET. Allocate jets to
   top 1 and top 2 so as  to minimize the mass  difference between the two.
   Assume the pair out of 3 attached  to top 2 closest in mass to W are the
   ones coming from W -> jets.

3) Pick the jet that maximizes the ET of top with W decaying leptonically.
   Assume the remaining up to 3 jets come from the 2nd top.


The package can be used in CALOR_OFF or D0USER frame. The driving
subroutines are:

In any frame:
LJTOP_CUT_INI  initialization, calls LJTOP_READ_CUTS to unpack control
             parameters in LJTOP_CUTS.RCP file

LJTOP_CUTS     event processing, calls FIND_TOPS1, FIND_TOPS2 and FIND_TOPS3
             to try the 3 algorithms. One can try any or all, choice
             controlled by flags in RCP file. Calls LJTOP_CUT_NTUPLES
             to fill N-tuples, if more than 2000 events are read 
             LJTOP_CUT_NTUPLES has to be modified to increase amount of 
             memory allowed. 
             If there is ISAJET data calls LJTOP_CUT_ISA to try the same
             algorithms on ISAJET data.
          
LJTOP_CUT_FIN  is called at job summary time. It is now a no-op entry point 
             in LJTOP_CUTS.

in D0USER frame:
LJTOP_CUT_DIAL called if option 'User Dialog' is picked. It allows modifying
             parameters in RCP at run time.

DST_DEFD     called for option 'Define dumps'. Provides dialog for chosing
             events to dump.

DST_DUMP     called for option 'Dump event' in interrupt menu


Each algorithm allocates enough room in PAWC to handle 2000 events (this
matches the default size of PAWC.INC). If all 3 algorithms are run
simultaneaously the size of PAWC must be increased by a factor of 3.
So it is recommended when making a program with this package to:

$ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACK=LJTOP_CUTS/PAWC=300000

you then link and run doing the standard things:
$ @LJTOP_CUTS_D0USER.LNK (DEBUG)
$ @LJTOP_CUTS_D0USER
$ D0USER/FULL

Users should modify algorithms by modifying FIND_TOPSi.FOR which can
be fetched from D0$TOP_PHYSICS$TOP_LEPJTS. This way the algorithm
will run on both real and ISAJET data. Note that if the arguments are
changed you need to modify both LJTOP_CUTS and LJTOP_CUT_ISA.
