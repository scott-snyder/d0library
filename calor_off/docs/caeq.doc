    This document describes the use/format of the CAEQ bank
which will will be retained in the 1B DST's.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
-----------------

    CAEQ is a compressed form of the CAEP bank which contains each of
the calorimeter hits in GeV. For each channel CAEQ contains the eta,phi and
layer index of the hit and the energy in the cell in GeV.  CAEP requires two 
words per channel while CAEQ requires only one word.  Thus CAEQ takes half
the space of CAEP.  CAEQ is a 'compressed' form of CAEP.  This compression
is achieved by dropping the low order address byte which CAEP contains and
storing the energy in 'counts'.  The stored energy saturates at -10 GeV
on the low side and roughly 420 GeV on the high side.  The precision used
is 2 MeV below 8 GeV and 50 MeV above 8 GeV.


Using CAEQ:
----------

    CAEQ banks will now be made in RECO in the CAHITS package. CAEQ will
hang from the PROC bank.  Just as CAEQ is produced from CAEP during
the reconstruction process, a CAEP can be made from CAEQ anytime later
by rerunning the CAHITS package on a file with CAEQ banks present.


a) To make CAEQ:

    CAEQ production from CAEP is controlled by RCP switches in CAHITS.RCP.
By default these switches are enabled.

-------------------- From CAHITS.RCP -------------------------------------

DO_CAEQFL       T           ! Make a CAEQ from the CAEP. Drop old CAEQ if 
                            ! present

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    When DO_CAEQFL is TRUE and CAEP exists, the old CAEQ (if present) is
dropped and a new one is made from CAEP.


b) To remake CAEP from an existing CAEQ:  The CAEP bank is used by
the various calorimeter reconstruction routines to make other banks
(like CAEH and CATE) which in turn are used for jet,electron,photon,tau
and missing ET reconstruction.  Thus it is desirable to have a CAEP
bank present in case reconstruction must be redone.  This is why
CAEQ banks will be kept on DST's, because one can then remake a CAEP and
redo calorimeter reconstruction.

    To remake the CAEP bank, you only need to include the CALOR,CAHITS
packages (CALOR is automatically included in CALOR_OFF, but not D0USER),
and run on some sample of data that contains CAEQ banks (1B DST's)
    The following switches control this:

---------------------------- From CAHITS.RCP -------------------------

DO_CAEPFL       T           ! Make CAEP
    CAEQ_TO_CAEP    F       ! If TRUE, drop CAEP (if present) and make CAEP
                            ! from CAEQ

---------------------------------------------------------------------

    When running CAHITS, one normally has DO_CAEPFL set to TRUE, that
is, one wants to produce a CAEP.  If CAEQ_TO_CAEP is TRUE and a CAEQ 
exists, the CAEP (if present) is dropped a new one is made from CAEQ.


Format of CAEQ:
---------------
    Each word of CAEQ holds the Energy, eta index (-37:37), phi index
(1:64) and layer index (1:17) of the corresponding calorimeter hit.
Note that the Byte  1 of the CAEP address word is not kept.

** Future version **

    The next iteration of CAEQ will hold Byte 1 of the first CAEP address
word in word 0 of CAEQ.  Additionally, one of CAEP user bits will be set
to flag CAEP banks that were made with CAEQ.
