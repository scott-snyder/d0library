                    Capacitance banks for D0 calorimeter
                    ------------------------------------


   The following utilities now exist for storing/reading capacitance
   values for all channels in the calorimeter.  The capacitance values  are
   stored according to their electronics address, by ADC crate.  The
   electronics address is 384*ADC + 48*BLS + 12*TOWER + DEPTH + 1 (=1-4608).

      A new set of ZEBRA banks has been created, hanging under SCAL in STP.
   The header  bank is CCPH.  Hanging under CCPH is CCPT, CCPC and CCUA.
   The CCPT bank contains the total capacitance values (cell plus cable).
   These values  are measured after the cryostat is filled with liquid
   argon.  The CCPC  bank contains the cell capacitance values.  This does
   not include the  cables or the readout boards.  These values are from
   warm measurements,  since cold measurements are not possible.  The CCUA
   bank contains the  effective uranium area values.  This does not include
   uranium which is  shielded by a readout board.

      The format of all three banks (CCPT, CCPC, CCUA) is the same. There
   is one bank per ADC crate - making a linear chain of up to 12 banks.
   The first seven words are header and the rest are the data.  The data
   is packed into integer*2 words.  All of the capacitance values are  in
   picofarads.  The uranium area is tentatively in cm**2.   (See the ZEB
   files in D0$ZEB$SCAL for details.)

   The raw data for the capacitance and U-area files are stored in
   D0$STP$GEOCAL:.  The files are named according to their corresponding
   ADC  crate number and type of data.  For example CPT_007.DAT contains
   total  capacitance values for ADC crate 7.  CPC_007.DAT contains cell
   capacitance values for ADC crate 7.  CUA_007.DAT contains the
   effective-uranium area values for ADC crate 7.

   The CAL_POSTGEO routine calls routines to read the raw capacitance
   files and write out a zebra file containing all the capacitance values.
   This file will be stored in D0$STP, as CCPT_STPFILE.DAT (for the CCPT
   bank), for example.  The CAPSTP routine reads the zebra file and puts
   results into ZEBSTP, for reference by the user.

   Also hanging under SCAL there is a link reserved for a CNSH (Calorimeter
   NoiSe Header) bank. As of now only the routines to book CNSH are coded.
   None of the code or files are yet in a release (anticipate a beta
   release in CALOR_UTIL/STP as soon as the next test release of those
   libraries comes out - within a week?). As of now only  total capacitance
   for CRATES 7, 17, 8, & 18 measurements are available. Other crates will
   become available as they are cabled up. Work is in progress to fill the
   CCPC cell capacitance tables with reasonable numbers. It is not yet
   known exactly how to measure the effective Uranium area of a cell.
