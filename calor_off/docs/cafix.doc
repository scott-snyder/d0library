                    CAFIX CORRECTION PACKAGE

    The CAFIX package is intended to work on D0 DST's/STA's.  It will
apply the D0 standard Jet, photon, electron and missing ET corrections
and overwrite the old JETS/PELC/PPHO with the new results as well as
producing new PNUT4 and PNUT5 banks which are intended to be the corrected
versions of PNUT2 and PNUT3. If the PNUT4 or PNUT5 are present they are
dropped and recreated.

<<1>>   HOW TO GET STARTED QUICKLY WITH CAFIX


    Since many of the routines used by CAFIX have been recently released
you should seriously consider remaking your analysis program with the
CAFIX package included using PROGRAM BUILDER.  This way program builder 
will make a .lnk and .com file which knows which libraries you need and
which RCP files must be defined.
    For example, if you are doing analysis with the DST package you could add
in the CAFIX package as follows:
 
/* 12/94 Note that now you need CALOR in your package list! */

    $   PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACK=(CALOR,CAFIX,DST)/ZEBCOM=3000000 -
            /ZEBSTP=2000000/SWITCH

    It is important that CAFIX comes before your analysis package so that the
corrections are made BEFORE you do your analysis. It is also a good idea to
leave the SWITCH option in. This way you are able to TURN ON/OFF the CAFIX 
package if you want and easily redo your analysis with/without corrections.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <<2>> Description of Corrections Applied

    a) Correction of photons and electrons: CORRECTEM is called to
    correct some (not all) of the PELC and PPHO banks.  In the case
    where a PELC/PPHO is corrected, the old values are overwritten with
    the corrected values.  See section <<4>> for routines which get
    the uncorrected values.  Only PELC/PPHO which satisfy the quality
    mask specified by ECORRECT_MASK in CORRECTEM.RCP, are 
    corrected. See CLEANEM.RCP for information about how this mask is defined.
    (Note: setting this mask to 0  would mean that all PELC/PPHO 
    would be corrected). From the electron ID point of view, we recommend 
    using the default ECORRECT_MASK which is set to '$00080' in CORRECTEM.RCP.
    The EM correction is then applied only to isolated PELC and PPHO, this is
    appropriate as the energy scale is derived using isolated electrons. For 
    DST and STA's constructed using D0RECO V11 and above, this bit is set if 
    the isolation fraction of the PELC and PPHO banks is greater than 15%.


    b) Correction of jets is done for all JETS bank and all algorithms.
    ( Note: that is the intention, but in this first release, the nearest
      neighbor algorithm is still not supported). If a jet contains
    a corrected PELC/PPHO (as defined above), the rest of the jet is
    corrected separately (using the em fraction dependant jet correction) and 
    the resulting corrected jet is the sum of the corrected electron/photon and
    the corrected rest of the jet.  Corrections for out-of-cone showering and
    noise/underlying event subtractions are controlled by switches in CAFIX.RCP.


    c) Correction of Missing ET is done as follows.
        - Differential 4 vectors (VCOR banks) are formed from the corrected
          electrons/photons and jets
        - Any VCOR banks made from subtraction of main ring energy (done
          only on events which were not micro-blanked) are identified
        - A soft recoil correction is applied and a resulting VCOR is made.
More on this:

( 'soft recoil vector'
    is defined as:
        -MET   - sum of found jets  - sum of found electrons/photons

       Thus the 'soft recoil vector' is the vector sum of all cells in the
calorimeter which were not a part of a found jet/electron/photon.  This idea
makes the most sense in events there is one object (e.g. a photon or a Z)
and nothing found on the opposite side. Often the other side contains a soft
jet which was not found by the Reconstruction program. This object needs to
be corrected and we call this correction the 'soft correction'. The amount
of correction is taken from the correction needed in Z+0 Jet events. )

    The final result of modifying the old Missing Et Vector by all these
corrections is stored in PNUT4. This is the corrected calorimeter missing ET. 
    Next the muon corrected missing ET is calculated by adding in the
'good' found muons of the bank to the corrected calorimeter missing ET to
make a PNUT5 bank.  'Good' muons are defined by the good muon mask in
CAFIX.RCP.  Refer to CLEANMU.RCP for the definition of this mask.  By
default only muons that pass 'usual' muon quality cuts are used. But
you can change this by changing this mask.

    <<4>>   Related Software uses to access corrected and uncorrected values


    Missing ET:
        Uncorrected cal and cal+muon are always stored in PNUT2 and PNUT3
    banks. Use GTPNUT(IPNUT....) or GZPNUT(IPNUT) to access this information.
    Corrected cal and cal+muon are stored in PNUT4 and PNUT5. You can
    use GTPNUT,GZPNUT in the same way to access this information.

    Photons/Electrons:
        GTPELC/GTPPHO returns uncorrected values if no correction has
been done and corrected values if correction has been done as this is
what is stored in PELC/PPHO bank. You can always get the uncorrected
values by calling GTPELC_GET_UNCORRECTED,GTPPHO_GET_UNCORRECTED before
EACH call to GTPELC/GTPPHO.


        CALL GTPELC_GET_UNCORRECTED
        CALL GTPELC(1,E,ET.....)            ! ET is uncorrected ET (for this
C                                           ! call only! )
C
        CALL GTPELC(1,E,ET,....)            ! ET could be corrected ET now
 
    Jets:
      UNCORRECT_JETS_BANK(LJETS,OVERWRITE,IER) : will modify the JETS bank
    specified and return it to its uncorrected state if OVERWRITE=.TRUE.
    If OVERWRITE=.FALSE., the bank is unchanged, but a subsequent call
    to GET_UNCORRECT_JETS_BANK(E,PHI,THETA,ETA,EMF) returns the uncorrected
    values.
      JETS_BANK_CORRECTED(LJETS,FLAG,IS_CORRECTED,IER):
      IS_CORRECTED is returned as TRUE if the correction specified by FLAG
    has been done:
        FLAG = 'COR'    : JETS bank has been corrected in some way
             = 'OOC'    : Out-of-Cone showering correction has been applied
             = 'ZSP'    : Noise subtraction has been done
             = 'UND'    : Underlying event subtraction has been done

<<5>>   Documented changes for MET Correction V2.1/JET Correction V4.1

    1) SOFT CORRECTION. Now, the default setting in CAFIX.RCP is that
this correction is OFF. Using this correction leads to better balance
of events, but increases the MET resolution, sometimes dramatically.
Also, its behavior when it is ON has been changed. Since this correction
seems to do the best in gamma + no jets / Z->ee + no jets and does not
seem to matter for the +jets cases, this correction is automatically disabled
whenever at least one  hadronic (EMF < .70  using the default MET jet 
algorithm- see CAFIX.RCP, default is R=.7) jet is present.

    2) Added/modified RCP switches.
CAFIX.RCP
    REPEAT_CORRECTION - Previously, when you run CAFIX, JET and MET corrections
                        are redone if they had been done previously. (EM
                        corrections are not redone if they have been done
                        before). If REPEAT_CORRECTION was FALSE, MET corrections
                        were not redone but JET corrections still were. Now,
                        neither correction is redone if CAFIX has been run
                        before and REPEAT_CORRECTION is FALSE. WARNING:
                        CAFIX is run for some non-microblanked events in RECO
                        to correct for mainring in the CH. If you leave
                        REPEAT_CORRECTION FALSE, such events would be skipped!

    USE_JET_CORRECTION - This new switch is under the DO_MET_CORRECTION switch.
                         By default this flag is TRUE and Jet Corrections are
                         used in the correction of MET. If this switch is
                         turned FALSE, they will not be.

    CORRECT_EM_JETS    - This new switch is under the DO_MET_CORRECTION switch.
                         By default, jets which contain 'good' em objects
                         (photons/electrons) have the 'good' em object corrected
                         by the EM correction routine (CORRECT_EM), but if
                         there is sufficient hadronic activity after the
                         removal of the em object (the jet might be made up of
                         a small jet and a em cluster), then the remainder is
                         corrected using the jet correction and the two are
                         added. (If above threshold.) Setting this switch 
                         FALSE, disables the correction of this remainder.

    ISYS                -This parameter is under DO_JET_CORRECTION, ISYS=0
                         gives you the nominal jet correction. 1,2 give you
                         the low and high error band around the correction
                         (one sigma). Before, ISYS was used only for the
                         jet correction (but met correction used only nominally
                          corrected jets). Now the ISYS correction is propagated
                         to MET as well. So if you ask for the high jet
                         correction you will get a different met correction.

    3) New Monte Carlo corrections for JETS

        QCD_JET_CORRECTION.RCP has a parameter called MC_JET_CORR. This
        parameter chooses which mc jet correction will be used. (The
        routines can tell if the input data file was generated with
        a montecarlo and automatically switch to the mc correction.)
        You have a choice of 4 corrections. The default is the MPF correction
        derived from ISAJET mc events. This correction is very derived in much
        the same way as the data correction is done. It has both the MPF
        and underlying event corrections. It lacks a noise correction because
        there is no noise (unless you run NOISY) in the mc. It lacks out-of-cone
        corrections (but for R=.7,R=.5, this is small). It also lacks the
        eta and emf corrections. This difference might be important in the
        intercryostat-region and forward region.

    4) Low ET jet correction change. Previously, the mpf portion of the
       jet correction, decreases below E=13 GeV (that is, there is less
        correction). This is due to the reconstruction threshold being at
        8 GeV. The correction was done in energy but the bias is in Et.
        Thus now jets with ET<13 but E>13 will be corrected less than they
        were previously. The mc mpf correction (see 3) above) is handled in
        the same way.

    5) Jet HV correction default for ntuple users.
    If you run on DST/STA's, the routine
    can figure out if you are analyzing data, the run number and the RECO
    version so that the appropriate HV corrections are made. Although you
    cannot run CAFIX outside of the usual D0 ZEBRA DST/STA environment,
    you *can* call QCD_JET_CORRECTION directly to do corrections in a
    standalone program or in NTUPLES. This jet correction is *NOT* the same
    as you would get in CAFIX but the difference is small and has to do with
    jets with 'good' em objects in it. If you do this, the routine CANNOT
    determine the appropriate HV correction, so it issues a message and
    takes the default. The default used to be correct for version 10 of RECO,
    now that has been changed to be correct for version 11 of RECO. The
    parameter is HVSCALE_DEFAULT and it is in QCD_JET_CORRECTION.RCP.

                                                            Changes Nov, 1994
<<6>>   Documented changes for MET Correction V2.1/JET Correction V4.2

    1) Large bug fix over version 4.1. Jets forward of eta=2.67 were corrected
        by 20-50% too much in version 4.1 (not 4.0). This is fixed.

    2) Small bulge produced near ET=24 GeV for R=.3,R=.5. Fixed.

    3) Noise/underlying event in ICD region modified. Small change.

    NOTE: As of this date, you must include the CALOR package when running
          CAFIX.
