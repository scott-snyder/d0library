USING THE NOISY PACKAGE
=======================


INTRODUCTION
------------

This document describes how to get started in running the NOISY package.  It 
does not describe all the options available in the package.  More complete 
documentation can be found in D0$CALOR_OFF:NOISY.DOC.  There are also a number
of D0 notes which are useful for detailed questions, e.g., 1274, 1399.


BUILDING A WORKING PROGRAM
--------------------------

Example:

1) Run the program builder:

$   LIBTEST ALL
$   PBD/FRAME=D0USER/NAME=NOISY/PACK=(CALOR,NOISY_TRIG1,NOISY,CAHITS,NOIANL)
/ZEBCOM=3000000/ZEBSTP=3000000

These are large common block sizes, you may want to experiment with them.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------

Example command file:

$   DEFINE DATAFILE       YOUR_MC_DATA.STA
$   DEFINE PILEFILE_LIST  PILE.LIST
$   DEFINE MYOUTFILE      YOUR_MC_DATA_WITH_NOISE.STA
$   @NOISY_D0USER.COM
$
$   DEFINE PEDS_HIS_FILE  D0$BETA:[STP]NOISY_PEDS_59138.HST4
$   DEFINE SPICE_DAT      D0$STP:D0ALPHA.SPICE
$   DEFINE NOISY_RCP      YOUR_VERSION_OF_NOISY_RCP.RCP
$   D0USER/NOSMG
OUTPUT
STA
MYOUTFILE
X
N
Y

CAD1
CAD2
CAEP

MANUAL
0
N
DATAFILE
X
N
10
0
Finish
$EXIT:
$   EXIT

The first commands in the file set up necessary logicals.  The D0USER input will
process 10 events and write the output to an exchange mode file, keeping the
CAD1, CAD2 and CAEP banks.  

You may also want to make sure that the CAEH bank is dropped, since it is very 
large and will make your NOISY output files difficult to manage.  In addition, 
if you try to run RECO on the NOISY output file it will crash if the CAEH bank 
is present before CAHITS runs (this is true for v12.10 and earlier versions.)  

PILEFILE_LIST should be a logical which points to a text file with a list of
filenames for the pileup stream.


SETTING UP NOISY_RCP
--------------------  

Examples:

1) To add noise to a MC event and zero-suppress (and nothing else)

    Set DO_SIGNAL                      true
    Set DO_PAST, DO_PRESENT, DO_FUTURE false
    Set DO_ELECTRONICS, DO_URANIUM     true
    Set DO_ZSP                         true
    Set N_SIGMA                        2.0 

2) To add N multiple interactions in the same crossing as your signal (and
   nothing else)

    Set DO_SIGNAL                      true
    Set DO_PAST, DO_FUTURE             false
    Set DO_PRESENT                     true
    Set DO_ELECTRONICS, DO_URANIUM     false
    Set DO_ZSP                         false
    Set CELL_SYMCUT                    0.0
    Set FIXNUM                         N
