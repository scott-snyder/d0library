    The CTAUS  package  consists of a  set of  interface  subroutines to be
found in  the group  CAHITS of  the CMS  library  CALOR_OFF.  The interface
subroutines call  utilities in CALOR_UTIL for  initialization and to create
the  banks PTAU   (BKPTAU,  GZPTAU,  PTAUFL). The  PTAU  banks  contain tau
candidates, tau  candidates are chosen by  examining the R(rms) of JETS (in
JTSH banks) and  requiring 1-3 tracks in a narrow  road defined by the jets
satisfying the R(rms) cut.

    The package uses  D0$CALOR_OFF:CTAUS.RCP for run control parameters and
requires that it be defined as  CTAUS_RCP. This is handled automatically in
the   xxxx_SETUP.COM  file   constructed by  the    program_builder. A file
overwriting  the  default   parameters can be  provided  by  defining it as
CTAUS_RCPE.

The following interfaces are part of CAHITS package:

o CTAUS :       generate PTAU bank and call CTAUS_ANL

o CTAUS_INI :   read parameter files and initialize

o CTAUS_ANL :   histograms

All of these interfaces are used in the D0$D0USER:CTAUS.PBD.
