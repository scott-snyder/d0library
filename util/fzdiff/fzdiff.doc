                                    FZDIFF



         FZDIFF is a utility program to perform a binary comparison
         two FZ files.  FZDIFF is primarily intended to check the
         consistency of FZ files generated on different hardware
         platforms (e.g. VMS and UNIX systems).  

         Any D0-supported FZ file format is allowed.  FZDIFF reports 
         differences in event structure, bank structure and bank
         contents.  The comparison of bank contents is
         format-sensitive.  Floating point quantities are not required
         to agree exactly to be considered equal.  


         Library files
         -------------

         All text files can be found in the FZDIFF group of the UTIL
         library (i.e. in D0$UTIL$FZDIFF in VMS).  All executable 
         files and documentation can be found in the top directory of 
         the UTIL library (D0$UTIL).


         VMS usage
         ---------

         Setup FZDIFF by typing:

         $ D0SETUP FZDIFF             ! Or @D0$UTIL:SETUP_FZDIFF

         This defines the symbol FZD*IFF and the logical FZDIFF_RCP.
         Setup is optional.  If the logical FZDIFF_RCP is undefined,
         FZDIFF uses the file FZDIFF.RCP in the default directory (if
         one exists) or from d0library.  

         Invoke FZDIFF by typing:

         $ FZDIFF file1/opt file2/opt

         The options may be arbitrary D0OPEN options.  No options should
         be required most of the time.  Either file (but not both) may
         be specified as "=" (equal sign).  This causes FZDIFF to
         compare a file to itself, in which case the only action is
         to produce a listing of the event and bank structure of the
         FZ file.


         UNIX usage
         ----------

         The top directory of the util library is added to one's PATH
         environment variable when the D0 environment is initialized
         (by d0local.login).

         Setup FZDIFF by typing:

         % d0setup fzdiff     # Or source `uff $d0util/setup_fzdiff.csh`

         This creates a symbolic link called fzdiff_rcp.  Setup is
         optinoal.  If there is no file or symbolic link called
         fzdiff_rcp, FZDIFF uses the file fzdiff.rcp in the current
         working directory (if one exists) or in d0library.

         Invoke FZDIFF by typing:

         % fzdiff file1:opt file2:opt

         The options may be arbitrary D0OPEN options.  No options should
         be required most of the time.  Either file (but not both) may
         be specified as "=" (equal sign).  This causes FZDIFF to
         compare a file to itself, in which case the only action is
         to produce a listing of the event and bank structure of the
         FZ file.


         RCP parameters
         --------------

         The library contains an RCP file called FZDIFF.RCP.   One set
         of RCP parameters controls file positioning and the number of
         events to process.  Other parameters control printout and how
         comparisons are done (including floating point tolerances).
         Refer to the comments in the library RCP file for more
         details.
