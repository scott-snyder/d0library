                                  FZBROWSE

FZBROWSE is a utility to allow you to browse in Zebra FZ files, call DBANK to
look at banks, call EZBANK to look for RCP banks, run DZSURV to give an overview
of bank structure and size and many other handy things.

To use FZBROWSE 

D0SETUP UTIL UTIL or @d0$util:setup_util or 

                                Windows version

FZBROWSE  and a motif window will appear.

    You can either read in the data over DECNET (which is done in the file
spec), or you can fire up FZBROWSE on the node which has the data, and send
the display to your node, over DECNET or TCPIP.  Here's what you do:

from the remote node:

$set display/create/node=<local-node>

to send it to you over tcpip, add /trans=tcpip to the end of this and make
the <local-node> an internet name

on your local node, you have to enable X-windows traffic.  do this in the
options menu, security, put *  in each of the 3 boxes on the upper right
and hit ok

    Hints:

To use the PRxxxx routines, you have to set the PATH properly

                        Ascii terminal version

If you don't have a window device, FZBASCII will get you an older version:

    You will be prompted for your replies.  The first question asks if you want
    to look at event data (presently a separate program does that); if you want
    to look at a STP file or a FZ version of an RCP or RZ file, say no.

To read an event file, do 
    FZ filename             (this only opens the file, does not read anything)
then one of the FILE MANIPULATION options, eg NExt or FInd

hints on EZBANK (for looking at RCP files)

EZBANK              (Harrison Prosper)

Description:- EZBANK is an RCP bank Browing facility that enables the
user to Browse through RCP Banks while in the Debugger. 

You are then given a menu of choices.  The basics are:

HELP            give list of commands
DIR             list known RCP banks
PICK bankname   focus attention on one bank
DUMP            dump to the screen the contents of that bank
