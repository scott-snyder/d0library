                                 EVNT_LIST.DOC

        EVNT_LIST.DOC is used to make a single line "dump" of events on a
    D0 Data file. The resulting output is in a file specified by the
    logical EVNT_LIST (EVNT_LIST.DAT by default).

        The "dump" contains a line/event of the following form:

     []DST_N_MUON_50GEV.GEN_I
     D0     BEG of RUN           0
     EVENT:            1 OUTPUT EVENT/RUN:        1234       98765 
        INPUT EVENT/RUN:           1           0   DST_N_MUON_50GEV.GEN_I

    where the last two lines are actually on one 132 character line.

        The 1st line in the input file name. 

        D0 and Zebra Begin and End run records are indicated, with the
    number of events *before* the record indicated. 

        Then there is one line/event which contains the sequential event
    number on the file, the output event/run number as entered by the Data
    Logger. The input event/run numbers are "beam crossing" numbers as
    entered by the Level 2 system (low order then high order). The last
    field is again the file name.

        These lists of events with run numbers and file names have been
    used to find the files that contain particular events. They have also
    been used to find out what files contain D0 Begin Run Records etc.
