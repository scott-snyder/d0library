			LOOK software forever!
			----------------------

I.     This LOOK software is a free software product.

II.    Restrictions:
	1. VAX/VMS v 5.X (and higher);
	2. VAXC compiler v 3.0 (at least I used this version myself);

III.   Some installation notes.
	LOOK software uses the following environment:
	    1. Symbolic name "look" to invoke LOOK software.
		Example: $ look :== $disk$a9:[kovalyov]look

	    2. Logical name "LOOK$HELP" - full command to invoke HELP
		as looking of help text file.
		Example: $ define LOOK$HELP "look view$view_hlp.view$hlp"

	    3. Logical name "LOOK$EDIT" - command format to invoke
		text editor you prefer. Syntax of this format:
		"Editor_name %s[ keyword_to_define_start_row %u]",
		(really usual C format specification).
		Examples: $ define LOOK$EDIT "ed/tpu %s"
		or:
		          $ define LOOK$EDIT "lse %s /start_position=(%u,1)"
		(I recommend you the last one if you have LSEDIT software).

	All this environment is defined by command file BUILDLOOK.COM
	(assuming that executable and help text are located in the
        default directory; default text editor - ED/TPU with no
	start positioning).
