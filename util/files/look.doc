		*** HELP FOR FAST FILE VIEWER ***

  *** Now you are using the viewer to read the HELP for the viewer itself ***
     *** Press 'X', 'x' or <EXIT>(F10) and return to view of your file ***
                    This file is d0$util:look.doc

   You invoke the viewer entering the command:

	LOOK[ file_name][ file_name...]

If you omit file_name,  the viewer will ask you for it.  Using '?'  instead of
file_name leads you to read this HELP. Wildcard in file_name is allowed.

   In  the lower row  of the screen  you  see  the keybar  enumerating  usable
alphabetic hot keys (both uppercase & lowercase are active).  Besides, you can
use the four cursor keys, <PREVSCREEN>, <NEXTSCREEN> & <FIND> (equals to 'F').
   Usage of cursor keys is standard.  But if you try to push the cursor out of
the visible space, it will lead either to it's change (e. g., previous or next
line will appear  or the text will scroll right or left)  or  to bell  warning
that you are  on the limits of the file  (e. g., on the beginning or the end).
   Using  <PREVSCREEN>/<NEXTSCREEN> keys  you can scroll the text by the whole
pages.

   Now you just used some of these keys to read the continuation.  Here is the
list of the hot keys:
   'P':	(the same as <HELP>(F15) key) invokes this HELP file to the viewer.
   'X': (the same as <EXIT>(F10) key) exits from the view of current file.
   'Q': quits from the viewer at all.
   'H':	leads to view  of the beginning of the file;  places the cursor to the
	very beginning.
   'E': leads  to  view  of  the end  of  the file;  places  the cursor to the 
	beginning of the last line of the file.
   'R': the first hit of this key places the cursor  to the right bound of the
	screen (if it wasn't there before); next hits scroll the text by pages
	in right direction (until possible).
   'L': the first hit of this key  places the cursor  to the left bound of the
	screen (if it wasn't there before); next hits scroll the text by pages
	in left direction (until possible).
   'F': (the  same  as  <FIND> key)  invites you  from the lower bound  of the
        viewer field  to input  the template  to seek for  in file;  search is
        case-insensitive & forward;  input templates  (up to 20)  are buffered
        (like commands in DCL);  found template is marked  by bold characters;
        if nothing was found,  then the diagnostic appears and you are invited
        to press any key to continue.
   'N': tries  to seek for  next location  of the template  given by  the last
	invoking of Find; search properties are the same as above.
   'D': executes a text editor for given file.
   'G': asks for  the number of line to go to  and after  line number entering
        goes  to view of the context of line  with this number.  You can enter
        number with percent sign (e. g., 32%),  which will lead viewer to view
        the  context  of  line  correspondent  to  given  percentage  of  file
        containing.  Note  that entered numbers  are buffered  up to 20 - just
        like search templates.
   'S': creates and executes the standard subprocess.
   'W': changes  the screen width  from 80  to 132 positions  and  vice versa;
	don't use it if your terminal doesn't support 132-position width.
   'T': (the same as '/') changes the mode of file  representation:  text form
        or hexadecimal dump.

   Then, the standard REFRESH key <CTRL/W> is supported.
   The REREAD key <CTRL/R> leads simply to reread the file from the beginning.

   In the upper row  of the screen  you see  the headline  showing  file name, 
cursor location (row & column) & the approximate part of file currently having
read (in percents).  When the viewer is working on something (e. g., finding a
template),  the headline disappears & the working diagnosis  (with approximate
file fraction  just processed)  appears in the last line  of the viewer field.
While viewer hard works on something you can press 'X' or 'x' (as if for exit)
& working will be simply stopped.

   Note that the viewer is filetype-sensitive;  i. e.,  when you try to view a
binary (non-text) file, the viewer will show it as a hexadecimal dump.

   If a wildcard presented  in a file_name,  an  "EXIT"  command ('X',  'x' or
<EXIT>(F10) key) leads you to view next file whose name satisfies the wildcard
template.  If no one found, viewer quits.  Analogically, if you specify a list
of files in command line, after "EXIT" you will view next file in the list. To
stop viewer execution at any moment, use QUIT (hotkey 'Q').
