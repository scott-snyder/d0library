            A program written by Marc Paterno has been modified to handle
    NTUPLEs outside of PAW.  The motivation is to allow the user the ability 
    to run in debugged mode if desired and that it is more CPU efficient.
        There are only four files located in D0$BETA:[QCD]:
    NTFRAME.FOR, NTFRAME.LNK, RNTFRAME.COM, and ANALYSIS.RCP

    1) The user modifies ANALYSIS.RCP with the list of NTUPLES that she 
    wishes to analyse.
    2) The user modifies the logical NTUP_RCP and the working directory in
    the .COM file.
    3) The user has to provide the following in NTFRAME.FOR:

        a) the RECL (NTUPLE record length.)
        b) the number of words of the NTUPLE: NWORDS
        c) the NTUPLE variables.  They can be obtained through PAW's UWFUNC.
        d) the user's variables.
        e) the names of directories and subdirectories as necessary.
        f) the necessary histograms to be booked.
        g) the analysis code.
        h) the program can handle up to 99 NTUPLES.  If the user has more,
        the code should be slightly changed or the program will crash after
        the ninety-nineth NTUPLE.

    4) The user links the program with NTFRAME.LNK in either debugged or 
    nondebugged mode.

    If there are any questions, comments, and/or complaints, please send mail
    to D0BR01::NANG.
