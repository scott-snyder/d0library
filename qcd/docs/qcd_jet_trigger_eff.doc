I) OVERVIEW:
    Routines have been written to aid the user in determining jet trigger
efficiencies.  The routines use results from real data and return trigger
efficiencies as a function of FILTER_NAME, Jet detector eta and Jet 
reconstructed Et.  Two routines are provided:
    
    1) A subroutine (QCD_JET_TRIGGER_EFF) allows the user to determine
the jet efficiency for a particular range of jet Et and Eta. Both the
efficiency and a binomial error are returned. (NOTE: You must use the
uncalibrated  Et returned by CAJETS. Dont use corrected ET values).

    2) A stand alone program (QCD_JET_EFFICIENCY) allows the user to 
get a list of jet trigger efficiencies versus Et or Eta for a given 
trigger.  Located in D0$BETA:[QCD].

    Both of these routines require access to the D0$BETA:[QCD] area.

II) EXAMPLES OF USE:

    1) SUBROUTINE QCD_JET_TRIGGER_EFF

        a) Remember (as with all QCD routines) you must have 
       D0$BETA:[QCD]'DEB'BETA_RELEASE.OPT/OPT in your link file. 

        b) Assume we want to know the trigger efficiency for 'JET_MAX'
       for jets in the forward region (eta from 2.0 to 3.0 for example)
       and with ET in the range 90. to 100. GeV

        REAL ETMIN,ETMAX,ETAMIN,ETAMAX  ! Kinematic range of jets
        REAL EFFIC                      ! Trigger efficiency to be returned
        REAL ERR_EFFIC                  ! Binomial error on efficiency
        INTEGER IMASK                   ! Set this to 0
        INTEGER IER                     ! Error code 0=ok
        INTEGER IVERS                   ! version number (see end of this note)
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
        ETMIN = 90.
        ETMAX = 100.
        ETAMIN= 2.0                     ! Eta is absolute
        ETAMAX= 3.0                     ! (this covers [2.,3.] & [-3.,-2.]
        IMASK = 0                       ! Dont ask why. Just do this.

        CALL QCD_JET_TRIGGER_EFF(ETMIN, ETMAX, ETAMIN, ETAMAX,
       &  'JET_MAX', IMASK, EFFIC, ERR_EFFIC, IER, IVERS )

        IF (IER .EQ. 0 ) THEN           ! IER=0 means OK
         PRINT 12,EFFIC, ERR_EFFIC, IVERS

III) METHOD:  
    Trigger efficiencies can be returned for the following filters:
    1) JET_MIN
    2) JET_END_LOW
    3) JET_END_MED
    4) JET_LOW
    5) JET_MEDIUM
    6) JET_HIGH
    7) JET_MAX

    The method used to determine trigger efficiencies is as follows:
    
    1) Efficiencies for a particular filter is determined by using real data
taken with a less restrictive filter:

    FILTER              LESS RESTRICTIVE FILTER USED
------------------------------------------------------
    JET_MIN                 MIN_BIAS, SPECIAL*
    JET_END_LOW             JET_MIN 
    JET_END_MED             JET_END_LOW
    JET_LOW                 JET_MIN
    JET_MEDIUM              JET_LOW
    JET_HIGH                JET_MEDIUM
    JET_MAX                 JET_HIGH

    2) Assume we are interested in the efficiency for triggering on an 
OFFLINE (Defined by CAJETS cone algorithm R=.7) jet in a certain ET and
ETA bin using a particular FILTER.  We then restrict ourselves to the data
sample which satisfied the LESS RESTRICTIVE FILTER (see table above). We
look only at events with no indication of a hot cell (BAD_FLAG=0, see
BAD_FLAG documentation in D0$BETA:[QCD] ). We also require at least 2 jets.
We only look at the two leading jets of each event.

    3) Define NBASE(ET,ETA,FILTER) as the number of these offline jets
which fell in the ET-ETA bin.

    4) Now we look at the subset of the LESS RESTRICTIVE FILTER data set
which satisfies the trigger requirements of the FILTER. (We are essentially
reconstructing the trigger decision using stored Level 1 and Level 2 
information.) Define NTRIG(ET,ETA,FILTER) as the number of offline jets
in this sample which fell in the ET-ETA bin.

    5) Define 
    EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,FILTER) = NTRIG(ET,ETA,FILTER)/NBASE(ET,ETA,FILTER)

    6) Note that this is simply the relative trigger efficiency. The full
efficiency is found by multiplying by the efficiency for all the LESS
RESTRICTIVE TRIGGERS.
    example: The absolute efficiency for 'JET_MAX' is found as follows:
    ABSOLUTE_EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,'JET_MAX') = EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,'JET_MAX')*
        EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,'JET_HIGH')*EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,'JET_MEDIUM')*
        EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,'JET_LOW')*EFFICIENCY(ET,ETA,'JET_MIN')

    Note that the trigger efficiency for JET_MIN is absolute.

    7) Special note about the efficiency for JET_MIN:
    Ideally the efficiency for JET_MIN should be done by using MIN BIAS events
as the LESS RESTRICTIVE TRIGGER. This would provide absolute efficiencies
for this trigger. However, problems with the MIN BIAS sample have forced
a different method to be used.  Instead of calculating the EVENT efficiency
for JET_MIN, the JET trigger efficiency was calculated. This is the probability
for the jet in the ET,ETA bin to DIRECTLY cause the trigger.  All of the other
efficiencies calculated are EVENT efficiencies, this is the probability for
the jet in the ETA,ETA bin to be in a triggered event (that is either the jet
DIRECTLY causes the trigger or some other jet in the event does).
Thus the calcuated efficiencies for JET_MIN are underestimates.
