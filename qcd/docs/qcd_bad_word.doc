                                                                Rich Astur
                                                                8/5/92

    We are using the following routine to determine whether any given EVENT
(not jet or electron) might be contaminated by 'hot' cells or main ring.


    CALL QCD_BAD( BAD_WORD, N_BAD, ETA_BAD, PHI_BAD, LAY_BAD )

Where: [R] BAD_WORD = 0 -> event is okay
                    = 1 -> failed CH fraction cut
                    = 2 -> failed max cell cut
                    = 4 -> failed level 1/ level 2 cut

        (Note, that events that fail more than one cut will be flagged by
         the binary representation of these numbers (e.g. 6= 4+2 ) )
         Also, the following 4 words depend on BAD_WORD

       [R] N_BAD = # of 'bad' conditions (e.g. # of trig towers that fail
                                            the L1/L2 cut )
       [R] ETA_BAD= eta of jet        BAD_WORD=1
                    ieta of max cell  BAD_WORD=2
                  lv1 ieta of tower   BAD_WORD=3

       [R] PHI_BAD= Same as above, but phi
       [R] LAY_BAD= ilayer of max cell BAD_WORD=2

        I have already modified the L1-L2 ntuple to include these 5 words.

The cuts are currently set at 
    CH FRACTION CUT                 CH/TOT     < .4                     
    HOT CELL CUT                    EMAX2/EMAX > .10
    LEVEL1/LEVEL2 CUT done as follows:

    L1_EM_ET = L1 EM ET of trigger tower
    L1_HD_ET = L1 Hadronic ET of trigger tower
    CAL_EM_ET= ET calculated from adding the ET values (according to CAEH bank)
        of all EM cells in that trigger tower.
    CAL_HD_ET= ET calculated from adding the ET values (according to CAEH bank)
        of all Fine Hadronic cells in that trigger tower.

    Require L1_EM_ET > SLOPE_EM(TT)* CAL_EM_ET - OFFSET_EM(TT)
            L2_HD_ET > SLOPE_HD(TT)* CAL_HD_ET - OFFSET_HD(TT)

    Where both the SLOPE and the OFFSET depend on which trigger tower
    eta is being tested.  These numbers were recently released by Kathy
    Streets.
    This EM cut is only applied for trigger towers in which 
    L1_EM_ET > 3 GeV .AND. CAL_EM_ET > 3 GeV
    and, similarly, the HD cut is only applied for trigger towers in which
    L1_HD_ET > 3 GeV .AND. CAL_HD_ET > 3 GeV
