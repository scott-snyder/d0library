                        A guide to using PYTHRA
                        =======================

                    (The D0 PYTHIA-ZEBRA Interface)

      This document is intended as a primer to guide the user through
     the steps required to set up and run the current version of PYTHRA.
     It is hoped that this document will evolve as the program evolves.
     The pace of documentation improvement will, to some degree, be driven
     by the amount and type of response from the community of users. 
     Therefore, comments and criticisms should be substantive and 
     to-the-point. Please direct suggestions to NGRAF@fnalv.com .

     Documentation of PYTHIA and JETSET is available on the WWW at:

         http://thep.lu.se/tf2/staff/torbjorn/Welcome.html
    
     For the D0 ZEBRA structure of events see:
                        
                        D0$ISAZEB:ISAZEB.MEM
    
     This structure of the ISAJET event banks has been maintained for 
     reasons of compatibility. Conforming to this structure causes 
     somewhat arbitrary decisions to be made, especially in the structure 
     and links between the ISAQ and ISAJ banks. The structure of final 
     state particles (ISV1 and ISP1) is, however, unambiguous.

     The file D0$PYTHIA:DECAY_PARTICLES.TXT provides a listing
     of the particles and partons and their branching ratios used in
     PYTHIA.  This can be used (via the MDME command) to supress decays
     of intermediate states into certain channels.

    GENERATING EVENTS
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    

    An executable version of PYTHIA currently resides in:

                D0$PYTHIA:PYTHIA.EXE
                D0$PYTHIA:DEB_PYTHIA.EXE

    To run this program:

    (1) Copy the file SETUP_USER.COM from the D0$PYTHIA area to 
        your local area and modify the logicals which define the 
        various output files.

    (2) Copy the file PYTHIA.RCP from the D0$PYTHIA area to your 
        area. Modify this file to customize the event generation. More 
        about this later.

    (3) Execute the command

        $@D0$PYTHIA:SETUP_PYTHIA

    (4) Run D0$PYTHIA:PYTHIA.EXE

    To create your own executable:

    (1) Copy the file PYTHIA_USER.FOR from D0$PYTHIA$SOURCE and
        modify it accordingly.


    (1) Copy the file PYTHIA.LNK from D0$PYTHIA and include the
        above routine (and any others needed for your analysis)
        into it. Executing this command file (with the optional 
        parameter DEBUG) will result in an executable which can
        be run instead of the default one. It should be emphasized
        that the cross sections derived from such an executable 
        should be used with some caution since the effects of any
        additional cuts will not automatically be accounted for.

    The RCP file
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The program is controlled by run-time parameters read in from a
    Run Control Parameter (RCP) file (defined as PYTHIA_RCP). A brief 
    glance at the PYTHIA manual will suffice to convince the user that 
    the number of variables under his control is quite large. Therefore,
    the structure of the RCP control is somewhat modified. Normally 
    one finds a list of variables with default values (and occasionally
    comments explaining the variable) and one changes these values.
    However, for the control of the PYTHIA variables, commands involving
    both the variable name and values are invoked. The user should provide 
    the commands in single quotes in the array USER_LIST_OF_COMMANDS. A 
    nominal amount of checking is done on the commands at this point but 
    the user is advised to consult the PYTHIA manual for full details of 
    command selection. Please consult to default RCP file for examples
    of the command implementation.

    For a description of the various MSEL and ISUB codes please refer to        
    Section 8 of the PYTHIA57 manual.

    The remaining parameters in the RCP file control such things as the number
    of events to generate, the number to print to the .LOG file, the extent
    of the printing, etc. The variables for PJET calculations are also set
    here. 

    Shortcomings and known problems
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The ZEBRA structure for the final state particles (ISV1,ISP1) is believed
    to be correct. Some "partons" are currently included in the ISAJ and ISAQ
    banks, but no guarantee for their accuracy is given. The links pointing
    between the banks are also not filled at this time. The results of applying
    the PJETS algorithm to the ISAQ and ISP1 banks have been compared and they
    appear to be in agreement. However, selecting multiple interactions causes
    PJETFL to crash, so it is advised that one set NUMBER_ALGORITHMS to 0
    when doing so. (It is not clear to me how PJET should be defined in such a
    case anyway.)
     Despite these and other shortcomings it is felt that a "release" at this
    point is warranted. Many studies can be commenced at this point using
    only the distributions of final state particles and do not rely on the
    exact structure of the event history. Response from users is welcomed.
