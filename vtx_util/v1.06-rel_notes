    - BKVTTH:  A ZEBRA bug was fixed.  A garbage collection caused by the
      MZFORM call in the first call to BKVTTH causes the supporting link
      LVTXT, passed as an input variable, to be invalid.  LVTXT was removed as
      an input, and instead is determined within the routine (the VTXT bank
      directly below VTRH is used).

    - LDVTXT:  LVTXT removed from call to BKVTTH

    - VSECHT: a typo was fixed so that the trigger offset would be handled
      correctly.  Also, the default for real data was changed to be
      appropriate for collider data (don't look for a timing pulse).

    - VTRAKS.RCP: The parameter containing the DBL3 file was changed to
      include a logical (DBL3$VTX) pointing to the correct directory on D0 or
      FNALD0.  The trigger offset (TRGOFF) was changed to be approx. correct
      for collider running.

    - VPOINT: Increase space in POIN bank to hold mirror hits, and add
      protection against overfilling.

    - VTRPAR: Do not crash the program if reading DBL3 fails (change 'F' to
      'W' in ERRMSG call).  Instead, fill the chosen banks with default
      numbers from the RCP file.  Three new routines were added to do the
      default filling:
                V_DFLT_PD, V_DFLT_TM, V_DFLT_GN

    - VTRAKS.RCP: default PD, TM and GN values were added

    - DEDX: M. Pang wrote a dEdx routine for the VTX.  For each track, it sums
      all the pulse areas from hits with good z info, using the TRUNCATION
      specified in VTRAKS.RCP, then converts to MIP units using the constant
      IONCONVERSION from the rcp file.  The user has the option of whether to
      include saturated hits (SATURATED in rcp file) and whether to do the
      sin(theta) correction (SIN_CORRECTION in rcp).  Note that for tracks
      with no theta information, sin(theta) = 1. is used, and that a bit is
      set in the status word of the track if the sin correction has been done.
            New routine:  VXDEDX
            Modified: FTVTXT
            New rcp params: TRUNCATION,IONCONVERSION,SATURATED,SIN_CORRECTION

    - Time to Distance:  Ed modified VTX_DRIFT so that for FAST = .TRUE., it
      assumes radial tracks (the lookup tables have been modified such that
      the first parameter is appropriate for radial tracks).  He also now 
      returns errors on the drift distance, calculated from a time sigma
      calculated as sig_t = sqrt( DT_RESA + DT_RESB*t ), and the drift
      velocity as returned by the new subroutine DIVDIFL, a linear
      interpolation routine based on CERNlib's DIVDIF.  A fourth lookup table
      was also added in order to parametrize the drift correction needed for a
      1% change in E/p; lack of knowledge of varying E/p can be incorporated
      into the drift error by adding the effect of a DT_ENV % change in E/p
      in quadrature with the time error.  One final change is that the region
      near the cathode is treated like a single wire pwc:  all hits in the
      region near the cathode where trhe isochrones break down are given a
      drift distance halfway between the breakdown point and the cathode (and
      an error appropriate for this assignment is returned).  The drift times
      and distances of the breakdown points can be obtained using the routine
      VDTMAX.
            New routines: DIVDIFL, VDTMAX
            Modified routines: VTX_DRIFT, VCOMBN
            New rcp params:  DT_RESA,DT_RESB,DT_ENV

    - The status word for VSEC hits was changed so that it would be possible
      to go back to the VWDA info used to make the hit.  This involved using
      two bytes of the status word to store the VWDA hit number; as a result,
      less of the VWDA status info is stored in the VSEC status word. (see
      VSEC.ZEB)
            Modified routine: VCOMBN

    - Old STA files from the blind events have VTXH banks that don't have a
      structural link for the compressed hit bank VHIT.  Modify the top level
      hitfinding routines to check whether there are enough links, and if not,
      drop the old VTXH and rebook it.
            Modified routines:VTHITS,VRHITS

    - New DTM maps: Ed's new VTX_DRIFT uses different dtm maps, based on
      radial tracks instead of tracks parallel to the sense plane.  Another
      table was also added to contain corrections for changing E/p.  In order
      to make these new tables available, a new version of VTX_D0STPFILE must
      be released in the STP library.  In order to become more legal in the D0
      software world, the routine INIT_VDTM was modified to read in ZEBRAized
      dtm maps instead of the binary files that Ed produces.  A program that
      converts Ed's format to ZEBRA format will be made available in the
      D0$STP$VTX area (MAKE_VDTM; after the STP release just execute 
      @D0$STP$VTX:MAKE_VDTM.LNK from an area where you have write access and
      an executable will be created).  Individual dtm files (other than the
      dtm maps within VTX_D0STPFILE) will be made available in the D0$STP$VTX
      area when necessary (suffix .ZDAT)
            Modified routine: INIT_VDTM
            Modified rcp params: DTM0_00 --> 'D0$STP$VTX:DTM0B.ZDAT'
                                 DTM1_00 --> 'D0$STP$VTX:DTM1A.ZDAT'
                                 DTM2_00 --> 'D0$STP$VTX:DTM2A.ZDAT'
            Note:  These parameters used to point to the [VERTEX] area on
                   FNALD0 (not a good thing in a library-distributed rcp
                   file).  In general, these parameters are not used, since
                   VTX_D0STPFILE already contains these (same) dtm maps.  In
                   order to use different dtm maps than those in the STP file,
                   set INIT_VDTM to TRUE and modify the file names above to
                   point to the desired maps.

        STP NEEDS TO BE RELEASED WITH VTX_UTIL IN ORDER TO HAVE THE PROPER DTM
        MAPS AVAILABLE (OLD MAPS WON'T CRASH THE PROGRAM, THO)

    - Pileup: It is possible to get pileup of hits at the anode (drift time
      .le. 0.) and at the cathode.  This results in several hits all with the
      same drift distance, leading to many duplicate segments.  In order to
      remove the pileup, ZFVSEC was modified to only store the last hit with
      t>= 0. and the first hit in the cathode region for each wire.
            Modified routine: ZFVSEC
