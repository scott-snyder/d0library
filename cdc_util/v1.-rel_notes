  4-MAR-1994 : Modifications released by Qizhong Li-Demarteau
 
    - CDINIT: removed DBL3 database reading

    - DSECHT: added DBL3 database reading and skip DBL3 reading when
              reconstructing from DHIT

    - DTRAKS.RCP: set REDOCDC and USEDHIT to be true.

 12-MAR-1994 : Modifications released by LAMI
 
    - PRT0DH,PRT0RW,PRT0TD,PRT0TZ: corrected format statement for IBM
                                   compiler.

==============================================================================

  7-APR-1994 : Modifications released by NORMAN A. GRAF
 
    - BKDHIT: changed MZFORM from 3I/1B 1I to 3I/1B 2I to reflect new bank
              format of three words per hit

    - FILL_DHITLIST: Removed REAL-INTEGER equivalences 

==============================================================================

  7-APR-1994 : Modifications released by NORMAN A. GRAF
 
    - DSECHT.FOR: Added DHTCHK to flag sectors when reconstructing from DHIT

    - DTREVT.FOR: Zeroed IQ(LCDCH+10) when reconstructing from DHIT

    - DSEC_FROM_DHIT.FOR: Fixed calculation of number of sense wire and 
                          total hits. When calculating from DHIT one
                          doesn't have information on delay line ends.
                          Therefore, I assign one hit per 3-D point, so
                          the total number of hits will always be less
                          reconstructing from DHIT than for RAW.

 10-APR-1994 : Modifications released by Qizhong Li-Demarteau
 
    - DSEC_FROM_DHIT.FOR and DHITFL.FOR :  changed pulse area to ionisation 
                                of hit (MIP) to avoid reading database when
                                reconstructed from STA

    - FILL_DHITLIST.FOR: the bug for negative drift time and bad Z position;
                         (removed N.Graf's change on equivalences, back to
                          the old equivalences, which works fine)

    - CDHITS.FOR: fixed the total # of CDC hits in CDCH bank


==============================================================================

 13-APR-1994 : Modifications released by Srini Rajagopalan
 
    - FILL_DHITLIST.FOR and DSEC_FROM_DHIT.FOR: Fix bug in fetching/filling
      Delay line status bits.

    - DTRKHITS.FOR: Modified to pick delay line quality from DHIT bank
      instead of DSEC/DCDA bank.

    - DHITFL.FOR: Definition of Delay line quality bits stored in DHIT bank 
      have been changed. See routine comments for defintion.


==============================================================================

 14-APR-1994 : Modifications released by Norman A. Graf
 
    - CDCHIT_INFO.FOR: Removed calls to CDHITS and DSEGME

    - DTRKHT.FOR: fixed argument list in call to DSEC_FROM_DHIT


==============================================================================

  1-JUN-1994 : Modifications released by Qizhong Li-Demarteau
 
    - MC_DTRAKS.RCP: Added parameters to enable the construction from STA
                     compressed hits bank

==============================================================================

 13-JUN-1994 : Modifications released by LAMI
 
    - ZFDTRK.FOR: Srini modification, pass 0 to MZLIFT to reset bank

==============================================================================

 15-AUG-1994 : Modifications released by Norman A. Graf
 
    - CDCISA.FOR: Added matching to DTRK banks

    - DISA_MARK.FOR: Finds and marks associated DTRK and ISAJET DITR banks
 
    - DTREVT.FOR: Added DITR option to match ISAJET and DTRK banks

    - GTDITR.FOR: Return CDC ISAJET track data from DITR

    - PUDITR.FOR: Prunes DITR bank

    - MC_DTRAKS.RCP: Added DITR option to match ISAJET tracks to DTRK

    - ( also released DRCOS.FOR into GENERAL and DITR.ZEB into ZEB for
         compatibility)
