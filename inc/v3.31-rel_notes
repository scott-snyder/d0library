 18-SEP-1991 : Modifications released by Susan K. Blessing
 
    - ZPULSER.INC  Reorder variables in the ZPULSER common block to put
       all of the character variables at the end.  This may fix the problem
       releasing CD_UTIL on NYUHEP.  At compliation time, all of the routines
       using ZPULSER.INC had %FORT-W-BADALIGN errors involving the NPULSE
       variable (an integer) which was located after the character variables
       in the common block.
