 26-AUG-1991 : Modifications released by Qizhong Li-Demarteau
 
    - ZTRINI: make sure it is called once only and remove the temporarily
              booked flags for subdetector's RCP file reading. These flags
              are booked in each DTRINI, VTRINI and FTRINI now.

    - ZFLZFT: added protection when no hits information are available

    - ZSTCMP: new routine to update the compressed hits banks for a ZTRK

    - ZTRAKS and ZCOSMC: added updating the compressed hits banks with
                         ZTRK information

    - CVROAD, FVROAD, FCROAD, FFROAD, ZTRCDC, ZTRVTX, ZTRTMP, ZTFLAG and
      ZDROP_TRACKS: 
        use bits definition from ZTRAKS.PARAMS instead of from ZTRAKS.RCP 
        file

    - ZFPARH: clean up by removing unused variables and useless statements 
              such as:
                       IF (FIRST) THEN
                         FIRST=.FALSE.
                       END IF
              which didn't do anything.
              
  ******** Note: The PARAMS should be released before this release of CD_UTIL
