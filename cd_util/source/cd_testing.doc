I.B  PROCEDURES FOR TESTING AND REPORTING THE RESULTS

TRD bug fixes via LOCAL CMS:  Because of the extra step of using LOCAL CMS in
TRD releases, special efforts are required to see that bug fixes reach BNL CMS
quickly, , so as not to hold up test releases   All TRD bug fixes should be
sent directly to Norman and a copy should be sent to Armand.  Norman should
handle these bug fixes separately from other TRD routines which may be under
development, so that they get into BNL cms quickly.  If he wishes to hold them
in FNAL LOCAL CMS while he finishes testing other TRD routines, he should check
with Tom about the timing of the next test release and be sure to get all fixes
in before the test release, whether or not his testing of other TRD routines is
completed.  Norman may, if he chooses, put the bug fix directly into BNL CMS
without testing it, assuming that the bug fixer tested it.  If Norman is
completely tied up, as is sometimes the case, he could request that the bug
fixer puts the routine directly into BNL CMS.  Norman must keep track of all
TRD routines put directly into BNL CMS, so that a second version from someone
else does not go through FNAL LOCAL CMS and overwrite the changes. 


II.  EVENT SAMPLES USED FOR CD MONTE CARLO AND TRACKING VERIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------
     
II.A.  SINGLE ELECTRON SAMPLE

The single track events  are 50 Gev electrons which all start from (0,0,0) with
no vertex smearing. For the central (CDC, TRD, VTX) region, the tracks are at
32 phi angles and  3 theta angles, 96 tracks total. These tracks never hit
sense wires or sector boundaries.  There should be all hits on all of these
tracks in every sector.  The tracks will hit a subset of the TRD sectors. In
the FDC there is one track aimed at each sector. All tracks should give hits on
every sense wire in the sector  and stay on the same side of the sense wires. A
detailed description of the single electron sample is given in  Appendix I.

Norman has set up an area on D0SFT where he will keep current versions     
of D0GEANT output of the CD single electron files. The area is:              
                                                                             
                    D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]
                                                                             
The single electron input file is:                                           
                                                                             
                           CD_ELECTRONS.GEA                                     
                                                                             
The output file with physics processes suppressed (all physics processes which
scatter or create more tracks are turned off) is:                         
                                                                             
             D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]SINGLE_ELECTRON.GEN1           
                                                                             
and the same events run with D0GEANT default settings is:                    
                                                                             
             D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]CD_ELECTRONS.GEN1              
                                                                            
The first file is useful for confirming geometry and digitisation.  The second
file, which has physics processes turned on, is useful to get an idea of the
efficiencies, etc.  The second file also has calorimeter information, so
it can be used to find clusters and do tracking in roads.

Other files which can be used for testing purposes are the ttbar events
in D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.ttb140] and D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.ttb120] as well as the
single pion files in D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.pions50].

III.C.4  TTRAKS
III.C.4.a  TTRAKS at Saclay
                  ********AZ, JG*******
Information from JG (3/26/90) for input to this document:  
Saclay now has a local CMS.  The procedure is to copy the routines of the CMS
library into an empty directory. They are then compiled, linked and the 
program is run on a 50 events single electron file.  Previously reported
problems are looked for and they make sure the problems have been fixed.
Note from TT (3/27/90)  You should also run on t tbar events.
Thanks for getting the ball rolling.  Yours is the first addition to the
document!!!  Edit this note out, but be sure to add t tbar events to your
testing procedure and find all tracks.   The trouble with only using single
electron events is that they never stress the programs very much.

III.C.4.b  TTRAKS at FNAL
Norman is having fairly good
success running ZTRAKS in the central region. TTRAKS seems also to be
working. He is now formulating some standard testing procedures to be
implemented.

APPENDIX A.  SINGLE ELECTRON SAMPLE - DETAILED DESCRIPTION

                 D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]CD_TESTING.DOC 

    (note that this is not the same CD_TESTING.DOC as you are now reading.
    Norman, would you be willing to change your document's filename so it 
    differs from this document, which is in the D0LIBRARY)


          SINGLE ELECTRON SAMPLE - DETAILED DESCRIPTION

This document contains a detailed description of the contents of the files
 
      D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]CD_ELECTRONS.GEA 
      D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]SINGLE_ELECTRONS.GEN1 
      D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]CD_ELECTRONS.GEN1 

which are to be used in testing the Central Detector reconstruction code.
An attempt will be made to keep these files current, generating them after
each test release of D0GEANT. Older versions will be retained as space 
permits. (The previous version will always be retained.)

D0GEANT is run with single 50GeV electrons. The input events are contained
in the file CD_ELECTRONS.GEA and are in standard ISAJET output format.
See below for a description of the events.

  The file D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]SINGLE_ELECTRONS.GEN1 was created using
the following settings.
All physics processes which scatter or create more tracks are turned off.  
This is done by using the following data cards (see FOR045.DAT):

    IPAIR 2
    ICOMP 2
    IPHOT 2
    IPFIS 0
    IDRAY 0
    IANNI 2
    IBREM 2
    IHADR 2
    IMUNU 0
    IDCAY 0
    IMULS 0
    ILOSS is left as it is in the default version.

This file is primarily intended to verify the geometry and digitization
code of the central detectors. The reconstruction efficiency should be
100% for all tracks.
Since all physics processes are turned off there is no calorimeter data.

  The file D0SF14$DKB0:[AMJ.CD_ELECTRONS]CD_ELECTRONS.GEN1 was run with the
default settings for standard production contained in the file FOR047.DAT.
It contains calorimeter information and can therefore be used to 
check the reconstruction within roads, etc.

 
    The single track events have the following properties:
 
50 Gev electrons.
 
All tracks start from (0,0,0), no vertex smearing.
 
For the central (CDC, TRD, VTX) region, the tracks are at 32 phi angles and
3 theta angles, 96 tracks total:
 
    Theta(m) = 60, 90, 120 degrees, m=0,1,2
 
    Phi(n) = (1/32-1/256)*360 + n*(1/32)*360 degrees, n=0,31
 
    Event Number = 32*m + n + 1
 
These tracks never hit sense wires or sector boundaries.  There should
be all hits on all of these tracks in every sector. The hit cell for a given n
is shown for each of the VTX and CDC layers. The tracks will hit a subset of
the TRD sectors.

Forward Drift Chambers:
 
     There is one track aimed at each sector.
 
Phi sectors.
     There are 36 tracks with
        Theta(i) = 17, 163 degrees, i=0,1
        Phi(j) = Phi0 + j*(360/36) degrees, j=0,35 where Phi0=2.5 degrees
 
     Event Number = 96 + 36*i + j + 1
 
 
Theta sectors.
     There is one track for every sector, at such a theta and phi
that it passes through a point 2mm out (away from the beam) from the center
of the first (closest to the track origin 0,0,0) wire in the sector.  All
tracks specified like this should give hits on every sense wire in the sector
and stay on the same side of the sense wire.
        Theta(i) = 7.61, 10.76, 13.85, 18.08, 23.265, 28.065, i=0,5
        Phi(j)   = 45., 135., 225., 315., j=0,3
and
        Theta(i) = 6.22, 8.815, 11.38, 14.915, 19.33, 23.51, i=0,5
        Phi(j)   = 90., 180., 270., 0., j=4,7
and
        Theta(i) = 172.39, 169.24, 166.15, 161.92, 156.735, 151.935, i=6,11
        Phi(j)   = 45., 135., 225., 315., j=0,3
and
        Theta(i) = 173.78, 171.185, 168.62, 165.085, 160.67, 156.49, i=6,11
        Phi(j)   = 90., 180., 270., 0., j=4,7
 
     Event Number = 168 + 12*j + i + 1
 
For quick reference and to avoid confusion, a list of the angles for the
264 electrons is included in the file CDELECTRONS.ANGLES.

If the user wishes to run a subset of these events through D0GEANT the 
datacard ZBIO 31 32 X can be used to skip X events and TRIG Y can be used
to limit processing to the next Y events. (One should define FOR031 to
be CD_ELECTRONS.GEA.)
