                  TRACKING_UTIL LIBRARY UPDATING RULES
  
Coordination between releases of different libraries is quite difficult and
requires care on everyones part. Please keep these rules in mind when updating
the TRACKING_UTIL library.
  
1.  All TRACKING_UTIL routines must go into one and only one of the groups
    CD, VTX, CDC, FDC, or TRD.  Structure charts go into group STRUC. 
    Only things in these groups will be released.  

2.  Those routines in TRACKING_UTIL which are used in D0GEANT or CALIB must 
    also be put in group D0GEANT or CALIB (in TRACKING_UTIL) in addition to the
    other group they are in.  

2.  Any routines added to TRACKING_UTIL, D0GEANT, or other libraries that
    require other libraries to be released should be reported to the czars 
    of ALL libraries involved.

3.  Release_notes should be updated every time you make changes in the 
    TRACKING_UTIL library using the RELEASE procedure.  You should include:
       a)  a general description of the changes, including what bugs or
           problems were solved by the changes.
       b)  a list of the new and updated routines.
       c)  a list of the routines, LINKS, PARAMS, and INCS that need to be 
           released in other libraries when TRACKING_UTIL is released.
       d)  other libraries which have to be released simultaneously.
       e)  an updating of the summary of problems at the beginning of the
           release notes.

The last item (3e) is a recent addition to the release notes.  This summary of
problems should be kept up to date by adding problems as you discover  them,
even if you are not currently adding the routines needed to solve the problem. 
It's purpose is to maintain a central place where all known problems in the
previous official release and the subsequent test releases are listed and their
status can be found. It will be released with the release notes to provide
information to everyone about the changes in the new release.  In this problem
list, your name and the date should preceed your comments, but, when
appropriate, you may edit down or remove others comments. The problem
descriptions should be edited down to their bare essentials as the problems are
solved, so that all that is left for solved problems is who found it, the date, 
a brief description of the problem, who fixed it, the date fixed, and which
official and test versions it affected.
