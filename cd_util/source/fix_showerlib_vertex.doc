			 FIX_SHOWERLIB_VERTEX

The purpose of this package is to fix up the vertex information
for early showerlibrary MC data.

Brief summary:

If you expect to be using showerlibrary MC data for reco 11.19 or earlier
include this package in your program (after udst unpacking, but before
any actual analysis).  If the data is showerlibrary, you must also
set the SHOWERLIB_DATA parameter in FIX_SHOWERLIB_VERTEX_RCP to true.
For v12 reco or data, it doesn't matter what you set it to.

Longer summary:

Showerlibrary is a problem for vertexing due to the small number
of tracks contained in the data.  Any VERT banks built by the
the vertexing algorithms are likely to be crap.  Unfortunately,
different versions of reco have dealt with this in different
ways:

  - For RECO <= 11.18, there was no general convention.
    We leave the VERT bank alone if it exists, otherwise,
    we make one at z=0.

  - For RECO 11.19, the ISAJET vertex was used by CAHITS,
    CAPHEL, and MURECO, but it wasn't stored in a VERT bank.
    We replace any existing VERT bank with one containing
    the ISAJET vertex.  This won't fix all the problems,
    since some other parts of reco used the reconstructed VERT
    information rather than the ISAJET vertex.  C'est la vie.

  - For RECO 12, the ISAJET vertex was used, and it was
    also put into a VERT bank.  We need do nothing for this case.

A further problem is that we want to do the above actions only
for showerlibrary Monte Carlo events.  It's easy enough to tell
if the data is Monte Carlo, but there is no reliable way
to find out whether or not showerlibrary was used.  So we require
the user to tell us via a RCP parameter in FIX_SHOWERLIB_VERTEX_RCP.
The package initialization routine will then set the flag
FIX_SHLIB_VERTEX based on this parameter.  Other code could also
in principle set this flag should it think it can do better.

The entry point fix_showerlib_vertex_oldvert gives people a way
to look at what the primary version was before this package
screwed with it.
