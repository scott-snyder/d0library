    Q_SOLVE is an interactive program in D0$UTIL which can answer many
queueing theory problems as fast as you can type the inputs.
This document is D0$UTIL:Q_SOLVE.PS.  To run the queue solver, 
@d0$util:q_solve
to link and run, and thereafter you can $run q_solve.exe on your own
copy.  The variables are defined in the theory description in D0 note 2708,
available on the D0 web pages.

Q_SOLVE asks you (case insensitive) for values for at least 3 of the four 
variables P,B,u (or R) ,D.
If you answer * for the value, it performs a loop over plausible values:

P:      1 to 100 by 1 for Processors

B:      0 to 50 by 1 for Buffers 

R:      0 to 2.5 by .05 (units of fraction of capacity/processor)

D:      0 to 50% by 1% steps

If you answer ? for the value, it will solve for that parameter.

If you give an explicit value, it will attempt the solution with that value.

Enter u or R as a decimal fraction eg 1.03 or .06.  

Enter D as percent, eg 5 means 5% and .1 means 0.1% .

The program is an endless loop, so control-C when you have had enough.  

Output is to the screen and to the file FOR020.DAT; output is supressed if the
deadtime is < .005%.

The solution for u uses the CERNLIB routine RZERO C205.  The value of u should
be accurate to |u-u_{true}| < .001(1+u).
