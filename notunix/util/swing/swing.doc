      SWING displays the current directory tree on a CRT screen for
interactive tree manipulation.  It is able to do the following:

      o  SET DEFAULT by moving from node to node with the arrow keys
         and exiting SWING when the current node is the directory
         desired.

      o  Rename a subdirectory.

      o  Interactively create a new subdirectory.

      o  Interactively move a subdirectory structure to a new position,
         with all of its children.

      o  Interactively delete a tree structure - each node blinks and
         then disappears as it is deleted.  This graphically does what
         the DELTREE type command procedures do.

      o  Create hardcopy of the current directory structure.

      o  Create a "binary save file" so the whole directory doesn't have
         to be searched each time SWING is used.

      o  Perform file-manipulation on the files in the current directory
         with the FILER option. Files can be edited, printed, renamed,
         deleted and moved to a different directory.

         - If defined, the logical name SWING$EDIT defines the command to
           invoke the editor. TPU (D0 EVE) is the default.

         - If defined, the logical name SWING$PRINT will be the command to
           print a file. For example, you can define it to be
           PRINT/QUEUE=TALARIS/FORM=R610P.

      o  Execute DCL commands with out leaving the SWING environment.

      o  Includes online HELP within SWING

      The SWING program is written entirely in FORTRAN and replaces a
lot of worn out command procedures that have been written over the years.
It allows the user to quickly examine and manipulate a directory
structure, saving time for the real work at hand.

      The screen manipulation is handled by the SMG routines and all
eight directory levels are supported.  The screen is switched between
80 and 132 columns as the directory tree changes size.  The display
scrolls up and down for long directory trees and commands are either
entered by hitting keys or by a pulldown menu at the top of the screen.
There is help while in SWING and a help file is furnished for the VMS
HELP library as well.  You have to try SWING to believe it.  It is
proof that computers can be easy to use!

NOTE:  SWING has been modified to D0 Standards and conventions by 
       A.M.Jonckheere, therefore the following NOTE is obsolete.

!NOTE:  GRC$TOOLS is a logical that must be defined in the system logical
