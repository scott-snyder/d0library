    Mega_Autocompare_Histogram preliminary release document.
    
    6-JAN-1994  R. J. Genik II
    18-JAN-1994 R. J. Genik II For new treatment of setup and building.

    This note is intended as a short introduction to the automated
    histogram comparison program MAC.

    Basically, it  is able to call HDIFF and HDIFFB for histograms stored
    in two files. HDIFF is a statistical shape comparison and HDIFFB is a
    bin-by-bin comparator. (D0 note 1916, the User Guide to HDIFFB, goes
    into much more detail than is appropriate to repeat here.) The package,
    which is formally called Mega_Autocompare_Histogram (MAC), is driven by
    an RCP file written by the user. It is termed an Instruction file, and,
    in some approximation, is a computer language. MAC reads this file
    sequentially and acts on a set of commands.

    A Demonstration DCL shell is available on fnald0 (not released because
    of the large amount of space the data takes up) which gives sample
    output. [Remember to do this from a directory to which you have write
    access, a FOR003.DAT file is generated with each run.]
    $@MSU6:[DATA.GENIK.L2_VERIFY]L2_VERIFY_DEMO.COM
    
    To run MAC you need to edit  the sample instruction file
    mac_instructions.rcp The sample RCP file is meant to be self
    explanatory. Upcoming documentation will be announced in the
    D0.Software folder of D0News so set notify there to keep up to date. 
    Type @d0$util:setup_MAC to setup some logicals and copy the sample RCP
    file to your current directory. $MAC will run the program once you've
    completed modifications to the instructions.

    Notes:

    Additional output parameters are documented, just not compiled into one
    file yet.
    
    Comments and bug reports should be forwarded to fnald0::genik. Note
    that the MAC command interpreter is very unforgiving for getting things
    out of order or missing single quotes, etc.
