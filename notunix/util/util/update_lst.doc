                Documentation for UPGRADE_LST and SORT_FILE_LIST
                ________________________________________________

    The command procedure UPGRADE_LST makes a list of file names that can be
    used as input for a D0USER or CALOR_OFF frame. The command procedure can
    optionally exclude files which are contained in specified lists from the
    output list.

    Syntax:

    $ UPDATE_LST <file spec> <output list file name> <list file name>

    <file spec>             - file specification of files whose names are to be
                              listed in the output list file. This parameter may
                              contain wildcards.
    <output list file name> - specification of the file that will contain the
                              output list. No wildcards are allowed.
    <list file name>        - file specification of existing list files. The
                              files listed in them will be excluded from the
                              output file list. This parameter is optional and
                              may contain wildcards.

    Example:

    $ UPDATE_LST D0$DATA$DST:*.*RGE* RGE_NEW.LST RGE*.LST

    will produce a list of all files with the specification D0$DATA$DST:*.*RGE*,
    except those that are already listed in RGE*.LST, and write it to the file
    RGE_NEW.LST. RGE*.LST could for example contain a list of files already
    analyzed so that RGE_NEW.LST will contain a list of all files that have not
    yet been analyzed.

    NOTE: the command procedure creates a number of files with the name *_pid.*
    where pid is the process ID number of the process under which the command
    procedure runs. Upon completion these files will be deleted.
