    MAC Commands Syntax:

    MAC Currently has 25 commands in it's language. They are described
    below. This document is written for persons who have already
    successfully written their own working instruction file and wish to
    customize the output for their application.

    General Syntax:
    The syntax is similar to RCP, except that MAC commands must be enclosed
    by single quotes. This prevents interference between the two command
    interpreters. (As with RCP, all character input must also be ''ed.)
    The MAC interpreter responds to commands between '\BEGIN_INSTRUCTIONS',
    and '\END_INSTRUCTIONS'. Instructions which are required (not optional)
    are described in the rcp file in more detail. Only the first ten
    characters in a command are required (for some it is less, depending on
    ambiguity), extra characters, up to 80 total, are ignored; for example,
    '\SET_OUTPU' is the same as '\SET_OUTPUT_FILE_TO:'. This allows the
    user to add as much English (or French, or Spanish...) starting at
    character 11.
    
    General Commands:

    '\HISTOGRAM_BEGIN'
    Begin describing one comparison. Must be followed by the 5 (or 6) 
    parameters which describe the technical details of the comparison.

    '\END_HISTOGRAM'
    Ends the comparison description. The machinery which does the
    comparison and produces the output is activated by this command, so
    optional issued commands before this command will apply to the current
    comparison.
    
    '\REFERENCE_FILE' filename
    '\DATA_FILE' filename
    Immediately closes the previous reference or data file and opens the
    indicated file. The new filename is immediately written to the output
    file. If the filename is a logical, it is translated by one step before
    output.
    
    '\SET_OUTPUT_FILE' filename
    Immediately closes the previous output file and opens the indicated
    one. The default output file (this command not present) is sys$output.

    Output Switches and commands:

    These were added at various development stages of the command
    interpreter and come in two syntaxes:
    
    '\SWITCH_NAME', '\NO_SWITCH_NAME'
    and
    '\SWITCH_NAME'  position 
    where position is .TRUE. or .FALSE.
    
    '\SHOW_BIN_CONTENTS'
    '\NO_SHOW_BIN_CONTENTS'
    Controls whether for each failure (bin comparison only), the contents
    of the bin are printed on the line after the test results.

    '\USE_BIN_CODES'
    '\NO_USE_BIN_CODES' [default]
    This is a historical compatibility switch. There are a class of
    applications (for which this package was first developed) where
    histogram channels are referred to by their channel number minus one
    (there is some logic to this, especially if one books 100 channels from
    0.0 to 101.0). Note: for two dimesnional histograms, the bin codes are:

        bin code for bin x,y = x - 1 + xbins*(y - ymin)
        where ymin is either 1, or 0 for underflow option
        and xbins is the number of x bins + 1 or 2, depending on over and
        underflow.

    See Below for description of bin names.
    (The author recommends using the channel numbers :-)

    '\OUTPUT_ALL_FAILURES'  position
    MAC will print each bin which fails EITHER the percent difference cut
    OR the statistical cut if .TRUE. .FALSE. will only consider bins which
    do not pass both tests as 'failures'.

    '\SUMMARIZE_ALL' position
    .TRUE. will print the 4 line summary of each comparison. .FALSE. will
    print "Histogram xxx OK" if no failures are found.

    '\CONFIRM_OK' position
    .TRUE. [default] will print "Histogram xxx OK" if no failures are
    found. .FALSE. will produce no output unless failures are present. (The
    author does not recommend using .FALSE. until stable instruction files
    are produced; after all, no output is the same as forgetting to put the
    comparison in the instruction file...)

    Bin Names:
    
    The user may associate a 32 character name with each bin in a
    histogram. The default is to label each bin as 'Unlabeled Bin' and
    reset to this label after each comparison.

    '\Bin_Codes_Begin'
    '\End_Bin_Codes'
    Allows the user to insert the bin names from the instruction file. See
    rcp file for syntax. Note that the default is to use the histogram
    channel number and not the 'bin code' described above when assigning
    names.
    
    '\READ_BIN_CODE_FILE' filename
    The bin codes will be read from the external file. The same syntax is
    used.

    '\RESET_BIN_NAMES' position
    .TRUE. [default] will reset the bin names to 'Unlabeled Bin' after each
    comparison. .FALSE. will keep the last specified bin names. Note that
    the names are stored in only one array; this can provide confusion when
    switching between one and two dimensional histograms. One of the
    advantages of setting this .FALSE. is an increase in speed as
    MAC doesn't have to fill this array (currently 40k elements of 32
    characters each) at the end of each comparison.

    Miscellaneous commands:

    '\COMMENT' 'text'
    Appears between '\HISTOGRAM_BEGIN' and '\HISTOGRAM_END'. Will add
    'text', up to 80 characters, inside the histogram summary if present.

    '\WRITE_DESCRIPTION' filename
    This command will write the entire contents of text file filename into
    the current output file, ignoring all lines where the first column
    character is "!" (Note the "!" must be in the first column.)

    Expert Commands:

    This class of commands exist because MAC originally was driven by two
    RCP files: the instruction file, and an "Expert RCP". To simplify the
    final product, the expert rcp, which determined the defaults for user
    set switches and also set some non-user oriented parameters, was
    eliminated and the defaults were hard coded; what remained was hard
    coded to default values and allowed to change by the following five
    commands. They are included here for completeness but need not concern
    casual users.

    '\SET_GTUNIT_ID' integer
    Sets the GTUNIT User id.

    '\SET_REFERENCE_ID_OFFSET' integer
    Sets the offset from the data histogram ID number which the reference
    is stored in \PAWC\. Default is 10000. (Internal Ref_ID = Data_ID +
    Ref_ID_Offset)

    '\SET_TMP_ID_OFFSET' integer
    MAC makes a temporary histogram in \PAWC\ to do the percent difference
    calculation, it is offset from the data ID number by this amount.
    default is 20000.

    '\DELETE_AFTER_COMPARE' .TRUE.
    Possible future use. Histograms are deleted from the \PAWC\ common
    block at the end of the comparison. Setting to .FALSE. may consume all
    available memory and cause a plethora of HBOOK errors.

    '\PCT_OPTION' char_string
    This controls the option string sent to HDIFFB (or MAC_2D_PCT_DIFF).
    It's default value is 'AZ'. See HBOOK manual or D0 Note 1916 for
    information about HDIFFB option strings. The effect in MAC_2D_PCT_DIFF
    only relates to the presence of a "Z" in the string. Z_option here will
    set percent differences to zero if there is zero entries in the
    Reference histogram bin. Also, if either the reference or the data
    histogram is empty (defined by the sum of the entries equal zero) an
    error message is written to HBUG which (without excessive intervention)
    will print this error message to the current output file; however,
    under the Z_option, the percent differences will be set to zero,
    instead of -999.0%. One consequence of using the default (Z option
    active) is that zeros in the reference are ignored, this is because no
    percent difference can be determined.
