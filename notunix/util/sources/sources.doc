                 D0SOURCES , A D0 Utility To Print Source Files
                 ____________________________________________


    D0SOURCES is an utility to build listings  of source  files. It produces an
Index of file  names and  entry points, and  pages are  numbered. A banner page
with optional comment is produced on QMS/TALARIS printers. 

                             ===== FUNCTION =====

    D0SOURCES reads the file specification(s) given  as argument to the command,
and read all the files corresponding to these specifications. For each file, we
add an entry in the Index, with file  name and first page number. Then, we read
the  file,  to  look  for  ENTRIES:   these are   defined  for  FORTRAN files (
SUBROUTINE,  FUNCTION,  ENTRY, PROGRAM  ), PASCAL  files (  PROGRAM, PROCEDURE,
FUNCTION ), MACRO files ( .TITLE,  .ENTRY ) and VAXTPU files ( PROCEDURE ). For
each of these  entries, a line is  added in the Index,  with the entry text and
page number. When  all the files are  processed, we read  them a second time to
build the real output  file ( defined as  SOURCES.LIS in the current directory,
or SYS$LOGIN:SOURCES.LIS if we can not open the previous one ). Then, this file
is sent to the printer, and automatically deleted after printing. 

                         ===== CALLING SEQUENCE =====

    At the DCL level, you call D0SOURCES like any other DCL command: 

    $ D0SOURCES {/qual}  file_specs

    where  "file_specs" is a  file  specification ( can  contain wildcards, and
many items  separated by  a comma,  like for the  PRINT command  ). You will be
prompted for if you don't give one. We never process the .DIR, .EXE, .OBJ and
.OLB files. The QUALIFIERs are: 

    /QUEUE=queue_name  to send the output to another queue ( default SYS$PRINT)
    /[NO]BANNER        to define if you ( don't ) want a QMS/TALARIS banner
    /COMMENT="text"    The text to be put on the banner page, if any. You will
                       be prompted for if a BANNER was requested.
    /CHAR_PER_LINE=nnn defines the number of characters per line ( 132 )
    /LINE_PER_PAGE=nnn defines the number of lines per page ( 64 )
    /FONT=nnn          defines the QMS/TALARIS font number ( no default )
    /FORM=name         defines the FORM to be used in the PRINT command
    /QMS               defines the QMS values: char=100, line=80, font=10
    /TALARIS           defines the TALARIS values: char=100, line=80, font=1217
    /KEEP              Don't print the file SOURCES.LIS, and keep it.
    /SETUP=name        On TALARIS only, to preset the font, char_per_line and
                       line_per_page using one of the standard FNAL setup, e.g. 
                       S814L or R610P...

    The default values are installation dependant: The symbol D0SOURCES is
defined with some default qualifiers, depending on the available printers.
E.g., FNAL definition will be SOUR*ces :== $D0$UTIL:D0SOURCES/TALARIS

                           ===== LIMITATIONS =====

    The number of  files and of entries  is limited to  1000, which is generaly
enough. If  the file  contains  Form-Feed,  they are  replaced by  "$" to avoid
problem with page numbering.
