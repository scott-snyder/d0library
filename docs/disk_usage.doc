                       Disk Usage Recommendations
                           D0 Offline Clusters

        On the two Offline Vax clusters in D0, there are 5 types of disks:
    System, USER, SCRATCH, PROJECT and UNIVERSITY (or TEMP). These disk
    types differ in the way they are managed, whether or not they are
    backed up and the types of usage that they are intended to support.

        1) System disks are for SYSTEM use only. These are critical to the
           operation of the machines and the cluster, and/or are
           repositories of commonly used software (D0$DISK). These disks
           are essentially read only as far as you are concerned. They are
           backed up every night.

        2) USER disks (USR$ROOTn) contain your login directories and are
           "USER OWNED". These disks are backed up every night.

           They should be used for *critical* files; private files (MAIL
           etc), source code, command procedures, etc. These are files that
           *must* be secure and can not be easily recreated (need backup).
           EXEs, OBJs etc should *not* be kept here. Data files should
           *not* be kept here. We have limited ability to backup disks. So
           we can't have too many of these disks, nor can any individual
           have too large an allocation on any one.

           These disks are quota controlled. We keep the allowed quotas to
           less than 110% of the total disk size (100% when we can). A new
           user is given only 5k blocks by default. Up to a limit, we'll
           increase this at request. Above that limit, you need a good
           argument for further increases. Almost always one or more disks
           of the following types can and should be used instead of
           increasing use of the user disks.

        3) SCRATCH disks: are disks that are automatically cleaned up each
           night. On all disks, each night a PURGE/KEEP=2 is done. In
           addition files older than a retention period are deleted.
           Directories on these disks are "user owned", ie) only you can
           create and/or delete files on them, with the exception of the
           automatic cleanup. There are no quotas on these disks.

           These disks should be used for EXEs, OBJs, LOG files etc that
           you need for a few days, but can more or less easily recreate
           and/or don't need for long periods.

           On D0SFT, there is *one* scratch disk: USR$SCRATCH:[user_name]
           with a four (4) day retention period.

           On FNALD0, there are *three* scratch disks:
                SCRATCH:[SCRATCH.user_name]             4 day retention
                SCRATCH04:[SCRATCH.user_name]           7 day retention
                SCRATCH05:[SCRATCH.user_name]          10 day retention

        4) PROJECT disks (PRJ$ROOTnnn) are disks "managed" by a designated
           member of a project group. A project group can be any group,
           often a physics group. The disk manager is responsible for
           determining what goes on a disk and how long it stays. They also
           GRANT and REVOKE the privilege of users to write to the disk(s) 
           for which they are responsible.

           Most of these disks do *not* have quotas. Quotas are only used
           when more than one project (or a project and a university) share
           a disk. They are normally not backed up automatically. The disk
           manager would normally back them up when needed. 

           These disks should contain the large data sets, "stable" EXEs,
           shared command files etc. needed to do a group's analysis. They
           are shared by the members of a group. Conflicts are resolved by
           the disk manager, who *should* know what the members of his/her
           group are doing. Since *each* member of the group (who have the
           RIGHTS ID that grants access to a disk) "own" all the files on
           the disk, cleanup and usage of the disk is controlled by good
           will under the direction of the disk manager, not by a "system
           manager" dictating usage. 

           To see what project areas exist, their precise directory names,
           what physical disk they are on, what machine that disk is
           mounted on, who the disk manager is, and what the size of the
           disk is, do: 

            $ DIR PRJ$ROOT:[000000]
                . . .

            Directory PRJ$ROOT248:[000000]
            000_D0UR03$DKA100.4000K;1               
            001_QCD_4000K_NOBACK.MILDER;1
            QCD_6.DIR;1
            Total of 3 files.
                . . .

           The 000* file name tells you the NODE, Physical disk name and
           size in kilo blocks. The 001* file name (can be more than one)
           tells you the Project, blocks allocated, whether it's backed up
           (normally not) and the username of the disk manager for that
           project. The .DIR file is name of the directory you'd use in an
           ACCESS command, and in any PRJ$ROOTnnn: access. ALL subdirectory
           names must be unique for ACCESS to work correctly.

           If you know the project name, you can find where they are by:

            $ DIR PRJ$ROOT:[000000]*QCD* for example.

           These disks can be accessed several ways. PRJ$ROOT:[prj_dir] is
           OK for reading files. But since PRJ$ROOT is a *huge* search
           list, don't SET DEFAULT to it. PRJ$ROOTnnn:[prj_dir] is better.
           "ACCESS/PRJ prj_dir" sets up three (3) logicals: prj_dir$HOME,
           prj_dir$HROOT and prj_dir$ROOT (see D0$DOCS:ACCESS_MANUAL.TXT
           for details) that make command procedures independent of
           physical disk moves etc.

        5) University disks (TMP$ROOTnnn) are identical to PROJECT disks.
           The "project" is University based rather than physics project
           based. They have a manager and operate under the same rules as a
           Physics Project. The only difference is that they are members of
           the TMP$ROOT search list, and the ACCESS command is ACCESS/TMP.

        It is expected that *every* D0 collaborator will have access to at
    *least* disk types 2-4. Many, if not most will also have access to one
    or more University disks. You'll be given access to a USR$ROOT disk and
    the SCRATCH disks when your account is opened. If you don't have access
    to a PROJECT disk, determine (DIR PRJ$ROOT:[000000]) which projects
    exist, the ones that you feel you should have write access to, and who
    the manager is. Ask them to grant you the RIGHTS ID to their disk(s).
    You should do the same for the University disks. If you are a member of
    a University who has supplied computing resources, you should have one
    or more disks available.
