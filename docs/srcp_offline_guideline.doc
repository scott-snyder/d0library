           Guidelines for usage and maintenance of SRCP files
                      in offline  programs

The SRCP system of handling parameters is being adopted for general
use for all D0 Offline packages, as agreed to at the Florida Workshop.
It is appropriate to agree upon a set of guidelines so that maintenance
and handling of the SRCP files does not become unduly complex.
The following is a set of guidelines which we have been able to arrive at.
Particular attention has been paid to the needs of the Program builder
and the fact that some of the SRCP files may be Run dependent.

1)All parameters controlling the execution of a program (Logical values,
Integer numbers and floating point numbers) should be input from
SRCP files. There should not be data statements in programs as in,

                 DATA ET_THRESHOLD/3.0/

or 

                 DATA DO_WZ/.true./

 The same applies to Conditional statements of the form,

        IF(ELECTRON_MOMENTUM .gt.15.0)Then

The numerical parameters in all these statements should be moved to SRCP
input files. The only type of DATA statement which we currently see being
allowed is

              DATA FIRST/.true/

              IF(FIRST)THEN
              FIRST = .false.
              ENDIF

which is commonly used to control local initialization in subroutines.

2)Every PACKAGE (in the program builder sense) should OPEN 
a logical file with the name XXX_RCP where XXX is the package name.
For example the package CAL (Calorimeter Offline reconstruction package)
will open a logical file CAL_SRCP. The OPEN should of course be done
using the subroutine D0OPEN.

3)The program builder will produce a command file XXX_SETUP.COM (where
XXX is the task name)
which will contain statements of the form

$Define CAL_SRCP  d0$cal:calorimeter.RCP.

The Physical filename D0$CAL:calorimeter.RCP is made known to the
Program builder. The Physical SRCP ascii files will have the extension .RCP
and will be kept in the same disk area as the release libraries. There will also
be a file provided by the program builder which will inturn invoke
all the various XXX_SETUP.COM .

4)Each package will access two SRCP files. One is the default set of parameters
and will be referenced by the mechanism above. WHile debugging, there is also 
the need to impose a small set of changes to the default set. This will be
done by accessing a file using the logical

     XXX_RCPE    (E for EDIT)

The program builder does not know anything about the EDIT stream. If the
edit file is not specified, the Package should continue execution by just
using the default parameters.

5)During the debug stage, the SRCP files will be maintained using CMS
in much the same way as .FOR files.

6)While going into production, we anticipate small run dependent corrections
to the default set of parameters. For this reason, the SRCP files will
be stored in DBL3 as ASCII files. The Default set will not be Run dependent.
The Edit set should be made run dependent in much the same way as other
constants such as Calibration.

7)In the SRCP stream, one specifies the BANK name to which the file
should be sent. In the package, upon re-entry, the user should Select the
SRCP bank before trying to access SRCP data. The SRCP bank name
should be the same as the Logical file name.

For instance, the Calorimeter SRCP bank should be called CAL_SRCP
and the edit bank CAL_SRCPE. This is specified in the SRCP control
statement /START. (See below)


8)All other data file names should be read in using SRCP and not hardwired
into the program.
