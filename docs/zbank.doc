  I have written a utility called ZBANK which enables you to automatically
write the routines necessary when creating a new Zebra Bank. The user 
puts in the following Symbol definition in his Login file. He should also
have in his login file @d0$beta_util:setup_beta_util so that the SWAP
symbol is defined.

  Zbank :== @d0$util:zbank.com

In order to invoke Zbank, the user types  ZBANK

The program prompts for the following input:

Name of new ZEBRA bank: CLRD                                                
Number of Links: 2                                                          
Number of structural links: 1                                               
Number of data words: 10                                                    
Format of Bank (.e.g -I/3F ): 4I/2F/3I/-F                                   
Name of Parent Bank : CACL                                                  
Structural link  from which the bank being created hangs off parent : 2     


At this point the program begins to copy the shell files over and
make the appropriate changes to them. The following output is generated.

When the program is done the follwing message is generated.

***********************************************

The files contain all the information supplied at the beginning 
in the appropriate places. the user must still edit the files to suit them
to his particular needs. The PRXXXX ,XXXXFL.FOR 
and the XXXX.ZEB files (where XXXX is the bank name) must be filled in
depending on the contents of the bank.
