        An interface subroutine supplied by users to the D0 program
  builder must satisfy the following before it can be maintained by
  the D0 library:
  
  1) It must be logical functions returning a value false whenever
  it failed to accomplish its task.

  2) It must have no arguments.
  
  3) The first 2 letters of an interface subroutine must follow the
  same rules as for ZEBRA banks, i.e.:
  Calorimeter interfaces must start with CA, Muon interfaces with
  MU, etc.
  
  4) It must be listed in a user package.
