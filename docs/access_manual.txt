                            - ACCESS MANUAL -

        In order to make accessing various disk areas more immune to
    disruption when disk areas must be moved, it is recommended that you
    *not* use specific device names, or even the system logicals whenever
    possible. Instead use the FNAL supplied ACCESS utility.

        The command syntax is: "$ ACCESS/type area_name" where type is PRJ,
    PROJ, TMP, TEMP, USR or USER to search for second level directories
    "area_name" in the search lists PRJ$ROOT, TMP$ROOT and USR$ROOT
    respectively.

        The command sets up the three (3) logicals:
    area_name$HOME  (top directory),
    area_name$ROOT  (rooted logical to the directory *above* HOME, and
    area_name$HROOT (rooted logical to subdirectories of HOME).

        You can see (or read) all of the areas of type "type" by:
    DIR type$ROOT:[000000], ie DIR PRJ$ROOT:[000000]. This should *only* be
    used to find the name of an area you want, when reading and when you
    aren't concerned about speed. When speed is needed, or to write, you
    *must* use either PRJ$ROOTnn (but this may change as disk needs change)
    or area_name$...
