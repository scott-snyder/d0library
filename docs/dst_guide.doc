    This document is a simple introduction to the standard DST contents and
its use.  The  standard DST  is just  a  subset of the  Zebra  banks in the
standard output (STA)  files from the  reconstruction program. The contents
of DTS's are not  necessarily fixed,  users can make  their own versions by
dropping banks from the  standard DST or may add  banks if they remake them
by a pass through STA  files. The "standard" DST  is what is written out to
the DST output stream of the reconstruction program.


    For  every bank on  the DST  there is  supposed  to exist a  subroutine
GTxxxx, where  xxxx is the  name of the  bank, returning  the most commonly
used quantities  in that bank. Thus  in principle users  don't need to know
very  much  about  ZEBRA. In   practice,  however,  in  order to  correlate
information between  banks users do eventually  need to use reference links
and this does require some minimum  working knowledge of ZEBRA. Reading the
first chapter  of the ZEBRA  user guide  (CERN Q100)  provides the beginner
user most of the information he will  need. There are also examples of how
to do  analysis with a  DST file  (using GTxxxx  subroutines  and accessing
ZEBRA banks directly) in D0$D0USER$PHYSICS:DST_ANALYSIS.FOR.


    The banks on a  standard DST are described in  the files with extension
.ZEB to be found in  directory D0$ZEB$DST. The  file DST_TREE.ZEB gives the
complete tree  structure and files  xxxx.ZEB describe  the contents of bank
xxxx. The  documentation  from any  ZEBRA bank  can be  accessed via the D0
editor EVE simply by

Command: ZEB xxxx

the only exception is  for the HEAD bank.  Because there are HEAD banks for
event-,  begin-  and  end-records  the  documention is  in  EVENT_HEAD.ZEB,
BEGIN_HEAD.ZEB,  etc. For Montecarlo  data the DST may  also contain ISAJET
banks, the documentation  for these banks is in  D0$ZEB$ISA (D0 versions of
PYTHIA and HERWIG fill the same ZEBRA banks as ISAJET).


    Standard D0  programs  linked with the  debugger will  also include the
DBANK facility, this allows users to  peruse the contents of ZEBRA banks on
a split screen with the documentation next to it (see D0$DOCS:DBANK.DOC
for more information on how to use it).
