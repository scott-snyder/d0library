  ABSTRACT
  --------
     This package has the purpose of doing further smearing to GEANT
  data in order to mimic the real detector resolution and to account 
  for the  sorts of inefficiencies  which  cannot  and should not be 
  applied in the Monte Carlo generation.


  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
     The GEANT has been generated assuming that the MUON detector is
  operating at the design resolution  dP/P = 20 %. The resolution we 
  have actually achieved is not as good but has improved  during the 
  course of the run. At this time dP/P = 20 % for low momenta but is
  closer to 50 % for momenta of 40-50 GeV. (See D0Note 1985.)  It is 
  impractical to generate different GEANT samples at various resolu-
  tions because of limitations in resources of all kinds. 

     Furthermore, GEANT could not have predicted certain inefficien-
  cies such as those incurred when, for  example, the AC fuse on the
  low-voltage power supply for one PDT fails for a few  days, or one
  chamber's gas leak causes it to be inefficient for an entire run.

     A single GEANT sample can be made applicable to both run 1A and
  run 1B by using different MU_SMEAR jobs to account for time-dependant 
  effects such as the changing resolution and efficiencies. MU_SMEAR 
  was written with this purpose in mind. 


  WHAT MU_SMEAR DOES
  ------------------
     The MU_SMEAR package does three things. First, it smears the raw
  muon data bank (MUD1) to worsen the time and delta time electronics
  resolutions. GEANT-only Monte Carlo has a drift time position resolu-
  tion of 200 microns and a time-division resolution of 12 cm. These
  are significantly better than what was achieved in practice. During
  Run 1A the time resolutions peaked at 70 microns and 20 cm was a typi-
  cal value for the delta times resolutions.

     Second, the package throws away hits from MUD1 in order to mimic
  the chamber inefficiencies (beyond the geometric ones modelled in
  GEANT). During Run 1A most chambers were about 90% efficient but the
  EF B and C chambers had dramatically lower efficiencies (near 50%).

     Third, the package misadjusts the geometry file in order to repro-
  duce the observed momentum resolution. At the start of reconstruction
  MU_SMEAR changes the position (in the drift direction only) of each
  chamber. It was found that a typical value of 3 mm was needed to
  degrade the Monte Carlo W->mu nu and Z->mu mu distributions to make
  them match RECO version 11 data.


  PROCEDURE
  ---------
     MU_SMEAR is intended to be run in between GEANT and any trigger
  simulation or reconstruction job. It can either be run as a stand-
  alone package, followed by RECO or TRIGSIM, or it can be linked into
  those packages. (It must be included as a package in front of TRIGSIM
  or MURECO or whatever when performing the PBD.) One RCP file is 
  required (logical MU_SMEAR_RCP) and the outputs are the smeared raw
  Monte Carlo data file and the changed geometry file. 

     If a reconstruction or trigger simulation program is built with 
  MU_SMEAR, the smearing of MUD1 and the geometry is done automatically 
  according to the parameters in MU_SMEAR_RCP. However, if MU_SMEAR is
  run as a stand-alone package, and the standard packages (e.g. RECO or
  TRIG_SIM) are run in subsequent jobs, one extra change must be made
  in order to get the "smeared" geometry. When the reconstruction or 
  trigger simulator is run on the output file from MU_SMEAR (i.e. the 
  raw smeared MC data), the MU_SMEAR_RCP is no longer needed since the 
  MUD1 bank has already been changed. However, the original Monte Carlo 
  geometry will be used unless MURECO_RCP is changed. In order to change 
  MURECO_RCP to use the "smeared" geometry file, set the following:
	(1) USE_DBL = 0
	(2) SMUO_FILE is 'your smeared geometry file'
  The SMUO_FILE to be used for all Monte Carlo generated with the
  default geometry, D0$STP:MUO_STPFILE_SRV_2.DAT, and 3 mm smearing 
  is MUO_STP_SRV_2_3MM.DAT
	(3) if it exists in your version of MURECO_RCP, the variable
  USE_STP_LIST should be set to .FALSE.
    

  MU_SMEAR_RCP FILES
  ------------------
     The resolution and efficiencies are contained PDT - by - PDT in
  RCP files. The following information is listed for each PDT:

      Name  Typical Value   Comment
      ----  -------------   -------
  1) ON/OFF      1.00       Example of use: LVPS fuse blown. 
  2) PL EFF      0.90       Pad Latch efficiency.
  3) T EFF       0.97       Drift-Time efficiency.
  4) T SMEAR     0.07       Drift Resolution in cm.
  5) DT EFF      0.91       Delta-Time efficiency.
  6) DT SMEAR    20.0       Delta-Time Resolution in cm.
  7) DT DBL      0.05       Delta-Time refired (not implemented).
  8) UNALIGN     0.30       Extra Position Smearing in cm.

     Two example .RCP files are in the library. One is the trivial set:
  MU_NO_SMEAR.RCP which contains parameters set up to do no further smearing.
  The other, MU_SMEAR_1A_V11.RCP, contains the best guess (as of 1-Apr-94)
  for the values of the parameters for run 1A global data taking
  reconstructed with D0RECO version 11. (V12 has better resolution.)
  For this second file, the chamber resolutions (T SMEAR and DT SMEAR) are 
  the actual resolutions for TIMES and DELTA TIMES for post-shutdown data.
  (Pre-shutdown resolutions are different but similar. See D0Note 2103.)
  The chamber efficiency numbers (PL EFF, T EFF, DT EFF) were also taken
  from data. These values were measured in two different ways (D.Hedin and
  K.Bazizi) which agree within errors. The values selected (those from 
  D.Hedin) vary PL EFF chamber by chamber but use overall averages for 
  T EFF and DT EFF. The extra position smearing term, by contrast, is not
  taken directly from a data measurement. Rather some additional smearing
  is necessary to make the momentum resolution of the smeared MC agree 
  with that observed in the W and Z mass spectra (see D0Note 1985).
  This term is a random offset (a Gaussian with width of 3 mm) to the 
  alignment in the drift coordinate direction for each PDT.


  HOW IT WORKS
  ------------
     MU_SMEAR copies MUD1 to the USER link (18) off the header bank.
  Then it deletes the original MUD1. It then steps  through the copy 
  and rewrites the  WAMUS data with the smearing determined from the 
  RCP file MU_SMEAR_RCP into MUD1's nominal location.  SAMUS data is 
  left unsmeared. There is protection against smearing real data. 

     The alignment effect is accomplished by checking the  MGEH bank
  once per event and offsetting the PDT in the drift view by the 
  amount determined  in the RCP file. Protection insures that the PDT 
  positions are changed once and only once.


  SOURCE CODE LOCATION
  --------------------
     The source code and the .RCP files are located in D0$MUON_RECO.


  KNOWN IDIOSYNCRACIES
  ---------------------
     At present there is nothing to prevent a user from smearing and
  resmearing and resmearing the same data, each time degrading the
  resolution. There is no flag which tells if the data is smeared.

     The 5 word crate trailer has a word which contains the number
  of words in the crate. MU_SMEAR does not change this word even in
  the case that some hits are removed. This doesn't cause any damage
  in present muon code. It could be used to tell if any hits are dropped.
