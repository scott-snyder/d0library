                     BEGINNERS GUIDE TO PAW_DI3000


     I. INTRODUCTION

        This guide allows the beginning user to read in a histogram file

        and display plots. For more detailed documentation see:

               PAW USERS GUIDE, CERN Long Write-up Q121
                               (Fermilab Comp. Div. number  SP0027,
                                obtained from the Fermilab stockroom
                                as item 1307-0100)

               PAW at FERMILAB (Fermilab Comp. Div. number  SP0027 A)
     
         For online HELP do:

               $HELP PAW (from VMS level on the FNAL cluster)

         For help inside PAW do :

               PAW> HELP   to obtain list of groups of commands. Then enter
                           command number to get further details.

               PAW> HELP command (to get information about a specific command
                                  or group of commands. Use / to separate 
                                  commands in path down command tree.)

               PAW> USAGE command (to get command syntax)


     II. SETUP

        A. DI3000 LOGICALS

          To use the DI3000 version of PAW, the DI3000 LOGICALS must be defined.

          This happens automatically on most D0 nodes. (There should be a 

          message on your screen at LOGIN time. ) If not try:

                $SETUP DI3000

                      or 

                $SETUP PVI (FNAL cluster)

          If this fails, see your SYSTEM manager.

      B. DI3000 DEVICE DRIVERS

          After the DI3000 logicals are defined, you must set the driver

          for your CRT device 1 (required) and hardcopy device 2 (optional).

          The form of the command is:

                 $SETDRV device code 1   device code 2

          Some common device codes are:

               GPV - VAX VMS workstation without DECWINDOWS

               XDW - VAX VMS workstation with DECWINDOWS

               T10 - TEKTRONIX 4010 emulator

               TLL - TALARIS laser printer

               LN3 - DEC LN03 laser printer


          C. DI3000 CONFIGURATION FILES
             
             DI3000 configuration files are available for the VAXSTATION

             with GPV or XDW drives. The only option for the GPV is: for

             a black/white screen whether the display background is 

             black or white. But for the XDW, the mode of "Window repair"

             (how to recover when a window overlaps your graphics

             window), is very important. If you are having trouble with

             this, use the template configuration file,

              GRAPHICS_UTIL$COMMAND_PROC:DRVXDW.CFG, 
   
              by defining the appropriate directory:         

                   $DEFINE PVI_CFG D0$GRAPHICS_UTIL$COMMAND_PROC


     III. GETTING PAW INTO EXECUTION
         
          PAW should be available as an executable in the CERNLIB area of

          D0LIBRARY or in it's subdirectory SRC. If it is not available,

          request it from the D0 Librarian of you Local Area Cluster.

          It is currently in the TEST area of some D0 nodes. So do:

               $LIBTEST CERNLIB 

          before starting execution. You may also want to move your 

          text window on a VAXSTATION to the bottom 1/3 of the screen

          to decrease the overlap between the text and graphics 

          windows. Then do:

               $RUN D0$CERNLIB:PAW_DI3OOO
                     or
               $RUN D0$CERNLIB$SRC:PAW_DI3OOO               

         Answer the question: "DI3000 Device name" with a Carriage return"

         You will get a non-fatal warning:

          "NO default PAWLOGON file defined" You can just ignore this.

         Or you can put a file PAWLOGON.KUMAC in your default area with

          one line: MESSAGE 'LOGON File'

         After a long initialization phase, the program should give a 

         prompt: PAW>

         On a VAXSTATION, after the graphics window has appeared, pop

         the command text window back on top to enter commands.

         A few basic commands are given in sections IV. - VIII.              


      IV. READING IN A FILE

          A. For HBOOK3 (old, non-ZEBRA type) file:

             HIST/HIO/HFETCH 0 filename


          B. FOR HBOOK4 (ZEBRA) file: 
 
             HIST/FILE 1  filename

             HRIN 0 (read in all histograms)

          C. CLOSE 1 - close histogram file
                      (HIST/DEL 0  - to delete all the histograms from the file)


     V. DIRECTORIES and LISTS

         
         A. To see the current directory:

              LDIR - Lists current directory and its histograms and the
                     names of its subdirectories

         B. To list information about histograms in current directory

             HIST/LIST  - list histograms IDs, titles and their dimensionality
                          (1), (2) or (N)

         C. To change the default directory (the one that you are displaying)

             1. to go to a subdirectory 1 level down:             

               CDIR subdirectory name


             2. To go to a subdirectory of the histogram file read in:

               CDIR //LUN1/subdirectory name (if unit 1 is the logical unit 
                                          of a histogram file read in)

             3. To go to the main PAW directory in memeory where any newly
                created histograms are stored:
 
               CDIR //PAWC     (PAWC is usually the top directory in memory)
                                           


    VI. MAKING HISTOGRAM DISPLAYS

         A. To set the command root:

              PAW> SET/ROOT HISTOGRAM (so don't have to type HIST at the
                                        beginning of each histogram command)


         B. DISPLAYING 1-D HISTOGRAMS
  
            PLOT ID# (plots histogram with ID# specified)

            ZONE NX NY (sets up NX zones in the horizontal direction and
                              NY zones in the vertical direction, so that 
                              multiple histograms can be displayed on the
                              screen.) 

         C. DISPLAYING 2-D HISTOGRAMS 


            1. PLOT ID# (plots a 2-d scatterplot with ID# specified)

            2. LEGO ID# THETA PHI makes a LEGO plot of
                               histogram ID#; (THETA and PHI are optional
                               parameters specifying the viewing angle in deg.
                               See HELP LEGO) 

            3. SURF ID# (plots a 2-d surface plot)

            4. Make a projection of a 2-d histogram

               HIST/CREATE/PROX id# (create X projection in main dir. //PAWC)

               HIST/PROJECT ID#  (fills projections previously defined
                                   for histogram number ID#)

               HIST/PLOT ID#.PROX (displays x projection of ID#)


    VII. USING N-TUPLES

         A. Plotting a single dimension of an NTUPLE:
 
            NTUPLE/PL ID#.X - make a 1-D histogram of the first 
                              variable in the NTUPLE


         B. USING CUTS WITH NTUPLES:

            NT/CUT 1 1<X     -   Cut 1 	is defined as X.GT.1

            NT/PL ID#.X 1  - plot 1st variable of NTUPLE ID# using cut 1


        C. Creating a projection of an NTUPLE:

            HIST/CRE/1DHIST ID2 'TITLE' NX XMIN XMAX - create a new
                 1-D histogram with new ID number ID2 with title TITLE
                       NX bins, and minimum and maximum limits XMIN, XMAX

            NTUPLE/PROJ ID2 ID1 Y  - projects the second variable of the
                                     NTUPLE with ID1 into histogram ID2


    VIII. MAKING A LASER HARDCOPY
 
         A. SETUP

          Before running PAW you must have set a second driver for the printer.

          For example:

           $SETDRV GPV TLL  (for UIS Vaxstation and TALARIS in line mode)

               or

            $SETDRV XDW LN3  (for DECWINDOWS VMS Vaxstation and LN03 printer)

        B. Inside PAW before making a plot:

            PAW> META 1 2 (turns on unit 2 as specified in SETDRV)

            PAW> (make plots, ex. HIS/PLO 1)

            META 0 2  (turns off device 2)

        C. After exiting PAW 

             PRINT TALARIS.DAT  (if had TLL device driver)

                 or 
  
             PRINT/FORM=______ LN03P.DAT   (if had LN3 device driver)

           NOTES:

           1. If the default print form for your laser printer is not 
              setup for graphics, you should check with the SYSTEM manager
              as to what form should be used. This is always needed
              for a LN03, but not always for a TALARIS printer.
 
           2. If you have a file PAW.METAFILE  (specifed META 0 0 ), do not 
              print it. You must use DI3000 program to read it.
