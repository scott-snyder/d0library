                     Guide to D0 Graphics 



  I. Introduction


   A. General Features

        D0 graphics includes histogramming, other data displays and event 
     displays. All D0 graphics applications use DI3000, the Device Independent
     3-D graphics package, sold by Precision Visuals, Inc., Boulder, Col.
     The D0 event displays, both online and offline are made using the
     package called PIXIE, written by D0 collaborators.  
     The displays work on a wide range of graphics display devices from TEK4010
     emulators and VT240s to VAXSTATIONS. The event display also work on the 
     Evans and Sutherland PS390, a high-end graphics device with 3-D hardware 
     rotation, using a DI3000 emulator written by the Fermilab Computing
     Division. It is also being ported to the Silicon Graphics workstation.
     

   B. Histogramming Packages

        D0 uses the CERN histogramming package HBOOK4. To display histograms
     it uses a variety of programs: HPLOT5, the CERN display program,
     PAW, the CERN Physics Analysis Workstation package and DISPLAY5, the
     SLAC-LBL display package, modified for HBOOK4 by K. Ng, Stony Brook.
     D0 uses the DI3000 version of PAW-HIGZ maintained by  the Fermilab
     computing department.

   C. Online Plots

        D0 has written D0HPLT, an limited online interface to HBOOK4 and HPLOT5
     using COMPACK, the D0 interactive menu. It allows the user to display, 
     reset and write out histogram files. There are also specialized histogram
     displays using DI3000 written by D0 in the Online event display package.
     The tracking group uses such displays for FADC traces.



   D. Online Event Display

        Online event displays are made by combining PIXIE, the event display
     package with one or more application display packages and EXAMINE2
     the D0 online framework. Two dimensional displays of processed hits 
     and cell information are available for each subdetector and in
     combined views. It can be run either in an automatic mode, where
     a few selected views are cycled thru as events are being accumulated
     or in a interactive menu mode, where the user has access to a set of
     menus. 







   E. Offline Event Display

       Offline event displays can be made by combining the PIXIE package
     with various frameworks such as D0USER and CALOR_OFF.
     The D0 event display program displays hits, tracks, E or Et in
     calorimeter cells (color coded), jets and missing Et. It can be
     used while doing reconstruction or on a standard reconstruction
     output tape. Two dimensional combined views are available as well
     as displays for each subdetector : muon, calorimeter, central drift
     chambers, forward drift chambers and transitional radiation detector.
     LEGO plots of Et for ETA-PHI bins are available for the calorimeter.
     It also displays calorimeter cells with energy above a minimum and
     reconstructed tracks in 3-dimensions.  Special 3-d plots and LEGO
     plots for DST files have also been developed. The display uses
     viewing parameters and interactive control parameters stored as ASCII
     RCP (run control parameter) files and read into ZEBRA banks.
