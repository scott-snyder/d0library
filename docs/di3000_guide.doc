 I. General Features

        DI-3000 is a commercial graphics system, which is designed
  
    to be device independent and supports 3-dimensional graphics.

    It has a library of Fortran-callable subroutines which are LINKed
  
    into the application using a special LINK procedure. It supports

    a variety of device drivers, which are ordered separately, depending

    on the hardware used at the local site. Dummy device drivers are 

    linked into the program. The user chooses appropriate devices drivers

    before executing the program, saving relinking for each different

    device. DI3000 is available from the Precision Visuals Co. of 

    Boulder, Co. A DI3000 Users Guide and a DI-3000 Quick Reference

    Guide are also available.


      DI-3000 is the graphics standard adopted by D0. All graphics code

   is written using DI-3000 calls. DI-3000 is supported by the Graphics

   Group of the Fermilab Computer Division.



II. DI3000 Logicals

   
       To use the DI3000 version of PAW, the DI3000 LOGICALS must be defined.

   This happens automatically on most D0 nodes. (There should be a 

   message on your screen at LOGIN time. ) If not try:

                $SETUP DI3000 (Fermilab)

   If this fails, see your SYSTEM manager.

   You must also get the shareable high precision version of DI3000.

   If this does not happen automatically on your LAC, (message will appear)do:

        $DISETSHR EXT HI           

   If you do not have this version of DI3000, you will get the following

      error message: " DI-3000 System error"

                   "you are calling a a DI3000 subroutine that is not available"


III. DI3000 DEVICE DRIVERS

 
   A. Introduction

      After the DI3000 logicals are defined, you must set the driver

      for your CRT device 1 (required) and hardcopy device 2 (optional).

      The form of the command is:

             $SETDRV device code 1   device code 2

      Some common device codes are:

               GPV - VAX VMS workstation with UIS (without DECWINDOWS)

               XDW - VAX VMS workstation with DECWINDOWS

               240 - VT240

               T10 - TEKTRONIX 4010 emulator

               HDS - Human Devices Systems (Fermilab)
               
            Hardcopy printers:

               TLL - TALARIS laser printer, LANDSCAPE MODE      

               TLP - TALARIS laser printer, PORTRAIT MODE      

               LN3 - DEC LN03 laser printer
         
               PST - Postscript printer


            To find out what devices are available on your VAX cluster, 
            
             $DIR DRV_LINK:DRV*.EXE

            The Fermilab clusters have all the standard drivers. If the

            driver you need is not available, send a message to the

            SYSTEM MANAGER.


 IV. DI3000 CONFIGURATION FILES
             
          A DI3000 configuration files is available for 

          each device driver. These files are ASCII (can be edited)

          and allow the user to set options. For some of the simpler

          devices, such as Tektronics 4010 (T10), this file is a dummy

          Read the comments in the files or the Device user guides for 

          more options and information.



   B. How to Find and Modify these files

          To use your own modified configuration file, instead of the 
      
          default file:

                 1. Copy the default configuration file from

                    DI3_DATA:DRV___.CFG to your own area.

                 2. Modify it according to the options described in the comments

                 3. Reassign the DI3000 logical by:


             $DEFINE PVI_CFG [],SYS$LOGIN,DRV_DATA

                   or

             $SETDRV []DRV___.CFG/C

       If you are using two device drivers, either copy both configuration

       files to your area, or set up a search list for the logical:

             $DEFINE PVI_CFG [],SYS$LOGIN,DRV_DATA

     NOTE: On some clusters, the appropriate logical may be DRV_DATA not PVI_CFG

             $DEFINE DRV_DATA [],SYS$LOGIN,disk:[PVI.USER.DATA]

           where "disk" is the appropriate disk for your cluster.


   C. Most Useful Configuration file Options

  
      1. VAXSTATION with GPV driver (non-XWINDOWS) 

             The main option for the GPV is for

             a black/white screen whether the display background is 

             black or white. 
      
      2. VAXSTATION with XDW (XWINDOWS) driver

             The mode of "Window repair"   

             (how to recover when a window overlaps your graphics

             window), is very important. It should be set to 4, unless

             the window damage job is not available on your LAC

             or unless this slows your node down too much. 
  

       3. POSTSCRIPT printer (PST driver)


            The postscript printer can have its color map set for

            COLOR, GREY or BI (black/white). Depending on what kind

            of printer you are going to use, set this parameter accordingly.


       4. VT240 (240 DRIVER)

            The VT240 configuration file can be set up for color. This

            is not only useful if you have a actual color VT240, but also

            if you are using the REGIS window of a UIS VAXSTATION.


 V. Hints for Using DI3000 on Various Devices


    A. VAXSTATIONS with UIS (non-XWINDOWS)

       
        1. If you are directly logged into the node:

           a. If it is back/white, check the SETUP MENU to be sure GREYSHADES
              is selected, if it is available.

           b. If it is color, set the color table map before running

              your program. If you change it in the middle, you will get

              strange results.

      2. If you use $SET HOST and want to do graphics on a remote node

          a.  LOGIN to a TEK4010 window and use $SETDRV T10 on the

              remote node

          b. LOGIN to a  REGIS window and use $SETDRV 240 on the

              remote node.
 
    !!!!! Warning if you do SETDRV GPV after doing SET HOST, you will

          get an error message when the program tries to open a graphics

          window: "ERROR IN PVINIT -  can not open window"
   !!!!!!


 B. VAXSTATION with XWINDOWS

          1. If you are logged into the node directly, use $SETDRV XDW

          2. If you use $SET HOST, you can create a remote DECWINDOW
             back on your original, (if the ACCESS AUTHORIZATION has been
             setup)

             $SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=original host

          3. If you are using a LAT terminal (in D0 HALL):

              a. Create a LAT-X window

              b. Do $SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=original host/TRANS=LAT     
        

  C. Tektronics 4010 Emulators

         1. General 4010 emulators - use $SET T10 or $SET T14

         2. CODONICS at Fermilab - use $SETDRV COD (slightly modified 
                                   T10 driver)  

         3. Human Device Systems at Fermilab - use $SETDRV HDS, unless
               it is a special XWINDOWS terminal, then use $SETDRV XDW

         4. Macintosh - use VERSA TERM PRO and create a TEK4105 window.
                        Use $SETDRV T10

                  Note: If you are at Fermilab, there is a separate MAC
                        driver, which allows separate graphics and command
                        windows. See the PAW on a Macintosh section of the
                        PAW AT FERMILAB manual, SP0027A.

 VI. Linking with DI3000

        For most large application, the user links with DI3000 by using the

     special command procedure DI3LOAD and has the option SHARE at the

     end. This allows the device driver to be set just before execution.

     This procedure is built into the standard D0 link files, either

     directly, for EXAMINE2, the online program, or as an option,

     for D0USER, do @task_D0USER.LNK DI3000.

        For small programs the user can either use the command procedure by:

        $DI3LOAD test SHARE  

     to be able to set the driver. If the word "SHARE" is omitted, the

     procedure will ask you for the driver code and if you enter it,

     the EXE will only be able to be used on that device. The DI3000

     library and drivers can also be linked directly. See the appropriate

     device user guide for more information. (This is very difficult

     for the XWINDOW driver).


 VII. DI3000 Emulators

      To speed up D0 graphics, two DI3000 emulators have been written

      by D0. These do not replace the need to buy a DI3000 license.

      Linking with one of these emulators is an option for the

      D0USER link file. For other applications look at the .OPT

      files below as an example of how to link in the emulator 

      libraraies.


     1. DI3000 emulator for the Evans and Sutherland
      

        To link with D0USER, do @task_D0USER.LNK EASDI3

        To link with other applications, see D0$UITL:EASDI3_UTIL4.OPT
       

        Contact Shariar Abachi, D0SF11::ABACHI for further information.

     2. DI3000 emulator for the UIS VAXSTATION


        To link with D0USER, do @task_D0USER.LNK UISDI3

        To link with other applications, see D0$UITL:UISDI3_UTIL4.OPT

        For information about hardcopy with the UIS emulator see

        D0$GRAPHICS_UTIL:UISDI3_USER_NOTES.DOC
