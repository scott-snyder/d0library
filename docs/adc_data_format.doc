                               ADC DATA FORMAT

                                 (REVISION 5)


     This is the fifth and hopefully the final version of the Calorimeter ADC

data format.  Since the fourth version of the ADC format (D0 note 678), some

minor changes have been made.  In particular, additional error conditions will

be sensed and reported with each event.  One point to note is that the

checksum word will in fact be generated.  And it will be made in each crate.

At the end of a data cable transmittion, a final trailing total wordcount will

be included.  The format of the header and both trailer blocks has changed

since last time.  A fourth word has been added to the crate controller header

which is to be written by the host and will be at the same location in ALL

readout crates.  The crate   definition has changed to accomodate all readout

systems and is described later.  It is to be used to indicate the

software/hardware version appropriate for the data being taken.  The crate

trailer, which used to consist of two longword has been expanded to four word

and the two word that are nominally the same have changed slightly in

definition.  This format is defined in the VME buffer/driver specifications

but is repeated here for completeness.  Finally, an end of transfer trailer

will be made, which will include a total wordcount, information about the

trigger being processed, and other possible information.  Its length and

format have not yet been specified.

     The digital processor that resides in each ADC crate is still in the

design stage.  In fact, whether there exists one, or if a more general

purposed array processor is included in each farm node is still under

discussion.  If it exists it is envisioned to utilize the z vertex information

from level 0 to perform the E-t and P-t calculation in hardware, to assist the

Level-2 microprocessors handle the online filtering.

                     8 bits - (least significant) ADC mode control
                          (MSB) 1 bit  - DSP enable, when sets means extra
                                         data block has been built (not yet 
                                         implimented). One=enable DSP.

                                         override.  When set allows
                                         external override of suppression
                                         for a particular trigger.
                                1 bit  - pedestal subtracted, when set
                                         means data has had pedestals
                                         subtracted.
                                1 bit  - zero suppressed, when set means
                                         data has been compared with limit
                                         and suppressed if appropriate.
                                1 bit  - sign suppression, when set means
                                         that the signed value has been used
                                         in the comparision.  Ignored unless
                                         zero supress is set.
                          (LSB) 1 bit  - data mode, when set means that data
                                         is used.  When cleared, means that
                                         pedestal data is used (for testing)
                                         Pedestal subtract is then ignored.

                           07=sign suppressed (not pedestal subtracted) data
                           08=same as 00

                           0F=sign suppressed pedestal subtracted data
                        if external override is enabled then add "10" hex
                                to above.  On the specific trigger where
                                the external input turns off suppression,
                                the 2**2 bit is turned of to indicate that
                                no zero suppression has been applied.
                        if DSP is enabled then add "80" HEX to above.

                                7 bits for the time slice
                                       (i.e. channel number)
                                4 bits for ADC card number
                          the order is such that all words are read
                            out in increasing order (except when
                            Calorimeter is forced to read out both
                            low and high gain)
                          these values would be identical for
                            each crate
