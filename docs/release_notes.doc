    The release notes for  a library are a  cumulative record of changes to
    the library. It is extremely important that they be up-to-date and both
    clear and complete. The release  notes are kept in a single CMS element
    called    NEW_RELEASE.NOTES. Each  time a  library  is  released, a the
    release notes are copied from the  CMS element NEW_RELEASE.NOTES to the
    release area  under a name  of the form,   release_class-REL_NOTES. For
    example for  the release  class, V1.12,  the file name  for the release
    notes will be, V1.12-REL_NOTES;1 and it is put in the same directory
    as the object libraris and executables.

    
    It is the responsibility of the Czar or Czarina of each library to make
    sure that the release notes are  clear and up to date before requesting
    a TEST or OFFICIAL release of the  library. To make it easy to maintain
    them a   special  utility  exists  which is  invoked  with the  symbol,
    RELEASE_NOTES. This runs a Fortran program of the same name.

    From a node of FNALD0, you can invoke the program by

      $ Release_Notes

      A Compack Menu will be displayed on the screen :

         1) CMS LIBRARY DEFINITION: The first thing to do is to 
            set up a CMS Library. So select this option and you will
            be prompted for a D0 Library. The program will expect
            an input such OFFLINE_UTIL,EVTMON or D0USER. If the input
            is not a valid D0 Library ( <==> [D0CMS.'your input'] doesn't
            exist), you will be prompted again for a valid input.

         2) SHOW RELEASE NOTES HISTORY: This option will display all
            the CMS history recorded for the release notes file.

         3) MODIFY RELEASE NOTES: Option which reserves, edits and replaces
            the release notes file in the CMS library.  If the file
            does not already exist, the program will create it for you.
            EVEDT (D0 Editor) is called by the program to edit the release 
            notes file which is an ordinary text (ASCII) file.  
            After modifying the file, the user will be prompted to enter a 
            CMS history remark and should do so.

         4) APPEND ONE  ITEM (to release  notes file):  this option invokes
            the  editor  not on  the  release  notes file  itself  but on a
            temporary  file  which will be  appended  to the  release notes
            file.
