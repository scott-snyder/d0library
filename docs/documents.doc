                           D0LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION
                           =======================

      All  documents concerning  the D0  software library  are maintained using
CMS. They can be either ready_to_print, and then must have a .DOC extension, or
RUNOFF files, with .RNO extension. ( Use of TeX is not encouraged, because this
product is not available at every D0  node, and standardisation of it's content
not that good ). The original source is in one of three possible areas: 

1) Documents  that are specific  to a  particular object  library, such as user
   guides,  reference  manuals,etc.  must be in  D0$CMS:[XXX]  where XXX is the
   appropriate  directory. If the  document is an .RNO file  the latest version
   will be in D0$XXX$SOURCE and the corresponding .MEM in D0$XXX If the file is
   .DOC or anything else, then the latest version will appear in D0$XXX. An MMS
   procedure handles this automatically, the writer of the document only has to
   insert the document in D0$CMS:[XXX]. 

2) Documents of a general  nature must be in  D0$CMS:[DOCS]. The latest version
   can be found in D0$DOCS,  if the file is a .RNO  file then the corresponding
   .MEM is in D0$DOCS,  otherwise a straight copy of  the latest version can be
   found in D0$DOCS. 

3) Documentation for  individual Zebra  banks must have  extension .ZEB and are
   maintained in D0$CMS:[ZEB], kept in  separate groups like the .INC files. If
   a Zebra bank  has changed  over time all  versions must be  kept in the same
   file with the latest version listed first. Each group XXX must have one file
   called  XXX_TREE.ZEB  with the tree  structure  for the  banks in the group.
   Copies of the  latest versions of any  .ZEB file can be  found in D0$ZEB$XXX
   and can  be  included as  comments into  any  subroutine,  for more detailed
   information see D0$DOCS:ZEBRA_RULES.MEM. 


    The   following  rules  must  be   followed  for  creating  and maintaining
documents, if not the documents will not be maintained. 

1) All documents must have name of author ( initials are not enough ) and
   creation ( and revision ) date.

2) The document must be inserted into the appropriate D0$CMS library and group.

3) The file D0$DOCS:INDEX.DOC is  updated by the release procedure, it contains
   for each document ( in D0$DOCS or  D0$xxx ) the file name, last update date,
   and a comment. This comment is the  one given to CMS when creating the file,
   so try to give helpfull information. If needed, it can be changed by the CMS
   command:   $CMS  MODIFY   ELEMENT   xxxx.yyy   /REMARK="New  remark for this
   document".
