          COORDINATE SYSTEM AND UNITS FOR D0 SOFTWARE
          ===========================================

      This note describes briefly the standard coordinate system for
the D0 software. Everybody should be familiar with it as any violation
is likely to have widespread repercussions.

      The coordinate system is right handed with the z-axis increasing
along the proton beam and z=0 at the nominal beam crossing point. The
origin for x and y is at the beam line with y increasing with height. 
Positive z and positive eta point south.  Positive x points east.
All distances are measured in cm. (conversions of inches to cm. will
occur before parameter files are created for use by the general 
software). The azimuthal angle phi is defined to be in radians from
0 to 2pi, with phi=0 for x>0 , y=0 and phi between 0 and pi for y>0.
The angle theta is given in radians from 0 to pi. Theta=0 for x=y=0
and z>0, theta=pi for x=y=0 and z<0. 

      All momenta and energies are given in GeV.
