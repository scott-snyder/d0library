 I have written a utility called DEFAULT which enables one to switch
between various Beta release and Alpha release areas by means of F18,
F19 and F20 switches on a VT220 compatible key board. To invoke this utility,
have in your login file the following command

 DEFINE/KEY/NOLOG F18 "@D0$UTIL:default XXXX " /NOTERMINATE/ECHO 

where XXXX is your User Id.

Then to invoke it for a particular Beta release area (e.g. Calor_off)

Press Key F18 and type Calor_off <cr>

The procedure the types the following messages.

   Set default to USR$ROOT:[XXXX.CALOR_OFF]                    
   Defined F19 to SET DEFAULT D0$CMS:[CALOR_OFF]               
   Defined F20 to SET DEFAULT USR$ROOT:[XXXX.CALOR_OFF]        
   Defined the symbol CMS_LIBRARY to CALOR_OFF.CMS             
   logical SRC has been defined to the BNL release Source area   

The user may then move between His alpha release area and the
Beta release area by using F20 and F19. The Beta release CMS library
is automatically set and the logical SRC will be defined to the
BNL release directory appropriate to Calor_off.

Presently the following Beta release areas are supported.

GEANT,EASEMU, CALOR_OFF, CALOR_UTIL, STP, DBANK, BETA_UTIL, TRACKING_UTIL.

More areas can be supported on demand.
