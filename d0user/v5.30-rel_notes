    - D0USER now uses HBOOK4. It is advisable for each package to define
      its directory when booking and filling histograms. One can go back
      to HBOOK3 by replacing UTIL4.OPT with UTIL.OPT in the link file.

    - Output streams are now handled with subroutines in the EVENT_UTIL
      facility. See D0$EVENT_UTIL$EVENT_IO:EVENT_IO_GUIDE.DOC.
      The output streams are identified by characters rather then numbers.
      STA is for standard output (all banks written out unless otherwise 
      requested)
      DST for data summary (only PROC plus dependents and supporting banks
      are written out).
      User can define his own output streams (they must be character*3)

    - All packages modified to match PROGRAM_BUILDER v1.10

    - New packages added:
      CALEVT:    calorimeter event reconstruction
      CANALYSIS: calorimeter event analysis
      MCDATA:    chose paths and banks to drop for MC data
      ISA_CAEP:  make CAEP bank directly from ISAJET banks
