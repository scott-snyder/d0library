    Made changes needed to run with ISAJET v6.0. This involved
mainly modifying the link files and changing the names of the
subroutines writing events to disk:
WRBEG --> ISAWBG
WREND --> ISAWND
WRTAPE--> ISAWEV

Subroutine ISARUN also has been modified so that it will ask for another
file if it does not find the DECAY table or a command file.
