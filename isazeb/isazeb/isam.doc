              ISAJET-Muon Simulation Package

   A simple package interfaced to ISAJET is available which simulates
muons in the D0 detector. It is implemented by calling subroutine
ISALFL(NMUONS). This S/R loops over all particles in the ISP1 banks
and sees which produce tracks in the muon system. Tracks can be formed
by direct muons, pi/K decays, or hadronic punchthroughs. If a track
passes through the iron for |eta|< 3.5, then a new ISAM bank will be
made (see d0$ZEB$ISAZEB:ISAM.ZEB).

   For each muon track, random probabilities are used to determine if the
track passed either the CCT or OTC trigger. Also, each muon's momentum
(and direction though this is not done correctly) is smeared using
an angular and momentum dependent function. No changes to muon angles
do to pi/k decay kinks or multiple scattering are included.

  GTISAM - get contents ISAM      ISAMDECAY  - look for pi/k decay
  PRISAM - print ISAM banks       ISAMKMU3   - decay related
  GZISAM - get ZEBRA pointer      ISAMTWOBOD - decay related
  ISAMFL - book/fill ISAM         ISAMLORTRN - decay related
  ISAMPUNCH - does punchthroughs  ISAMPROJ   - simple geometry
  ISAMRES   - momentum resolution ISAMTREFF  - trigger efficiency

--DH 4-1-91  Improve ISAMPROJ with slightly better theta dependence of
             the thickness (by Dave Fein).
             Add 'A' layer muons. they would range out in the iron and
             will have ISOURCE = 10,11,12. The momentum will be halfway
             through the iron. Also, prompt muons which range out in the
             calorimeter will be saved as ISOURCE = 20. Fix some problems
             for low momentum punchthroughs.
