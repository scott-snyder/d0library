  9-JUN-1993 : Modifications released by Herbert Greenlee
 
    - This is the initial release of LCOMPACK (line-mode compack).  This
      library is basically that subset of COMPACK that is needed for the 
      NOSMG mode of COMPACK.  It is written in mostly standard fortran (there
      are no SMG calls).  It is intended to be transportable to all UNIXes.
