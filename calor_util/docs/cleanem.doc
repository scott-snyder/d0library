                        Electron Selection Package

    COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY :
        In the current Beta release of Calor_off the electron selection package
    COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY is available. This package computes the "QUALITY"
    of all the electrons/photons in the event and stores it in form of a bit
    mask in the corresponding PELC/PPHO banks. To determine the quality of the
    electron it uses the information stored in the DST. To use it just include
    this package BEFORE your analysis package. 

    Inclusion of this package assumes that the user wants to determine the 
    quality flag using the new value of the cuts from CLEANEM.RCP and overwrites
    any previously saved status words. If one does not wish to overwrite any
    previous information, then the user routine can directly access the 
    status word by using the routine CLEANEM.

    Note that for versions 1 and 2 of PELC/PPHO there is no default status word
    saved on the DST whereas for version 3 onwards the status word will be
    available in word 30 of PELC/PPHO. 


    
    CHECK_EM_QUALITY :
        This routine can be used to  check the quality of the electron/photon
    cluster. Given the link to the bank and a user defined "quality mask",
    it tests the status word already saved in PELC/PPHO using the
    "quality mask/usermask". If none of the bits being tested by the 
    usermask is set in the status word, it flags the candidate as "good" 
    by returning true for the last argument - OK.

      SUBROUTINE CHECK_EM_QUALITY(LCLUS,USERMASK,OK)
C----------------------------------------------------------------------
C-
C-   Purpose and Methods : uses USERMASK to check the quality of
C-                         electron/photon cluster
C-
C-   Inputs  : LCLUS : Link to electron, photon cluster
C-             USERMASK = user define electron/photon quality mask
C-
C-   Outputs : OK = .true. if electron satifies USERMASK





    CLEANEM :
        The electron selection package COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY uses this subroutine
    to determine the status word. The current version of CLEANEM has several new
    features and the bit assignment in the status word has changed. The cut
    values are determined using CLEANEM.RCP.

    There are four entry points available in CLEANEM which return information
    for the individual electron/photon cluster on some of the variables used 
    in computing the status flag. These are

        CLEANEM_CQUANS(NCVAR,CQUAN) 
         can be used to access information on the variables which primarily use
         the calorimeter information to define the electron quality for a given
         cluster. NCVAR is the number of variables for which information is
         available and their values are returned in the vector CQUAN(NCVAR).
        CLEANEM_CQUAN_NAMES(NCVAR,CQUAN_NAMES) 
         returns the name tags of these qualities in the vector
         CQUAN_NAMES(NCVAR). This can be called once during intialization.

        CLEANEM_TQUANS(NCVAR,TQUAN)
         can be used to access information on the variables which are based 
         on matching of tracking information with the calorimeter cluster
         to define the electron quality for a given cluster.
         NTVAR is the number of variables for which information is
         available and their values are returned in the vector TQUAN(NTVAR).
        CLEANEM_TQUAN_NAMES(NTVAR,TQUAN_NAMES) 
         supplies the name tags of these qualities in the vector
         TQUAN_NAMES(NTVAR). This can be called once during intialization.

    Here is a brief explanation of the variables used in CLEANEM to 
    determine the quality flag word. 

    - Coarse/Fine Hmatrix Chiquared :
       At the moment this cut is eta dependent. The Coarse chisq cut is 98%
       efficient while the tighter Fine chisquared cut is set at 90% electron
       efficiency.

    - CC em flag
       This bit is set for electron/photons in the CC.

    - cluster EM fraction
       cuts on fractional energy deposited by the cluster in the EM calorimeter.

    - core energy cut
       This is the cut on the fractional energy in the Core Cone (0.2)
       which is contained outside the EM cluster.

    - transverse dispersion cut
       RMS width of the cluster in cartesian coordinates.

    - sigma5-sigma3
        A comparison of reconstructed electron with Level2 electrons in the 
      CC can be done by using this tranverse electron shape variable.

    - Isolation cut Energy (Cone 1,2)
        Requires isolation of the EM cluster by determining  whether 
      there is a significant fraction of energy in a cone of a given radius 
      (set by ISOL_CONE_SIZE) outside the core cone of radius 0.2. 
       Two isolation cones of radii 0.4 and  0.6 are implemented. 
        
            fisol(1) = (E(cone(r1)) - E(cone(0.2))) / E(cone(0.2))

    - Isolation cut ET (Cone 1/2)
        same as above but use Et instead of E.

    - Close to crack flag
       determines whether the electron is close to a phi crack in CC

    - Number of cells below minimum
        cut on the minimum number of cells asscociated with the cluster 
      in order of eliminate clusters due to noisy calorimeter cells.

    - L2/RECO match
        bit is set if the reconstructed electron/photon has also been found by
      the Level2 electron algorithm. This match does not make any requirements
      on the Et of the Level2 objects.

    - Distance 1 cut (Rdeltaphi for CC and EC)
        cut on maximum distance perpendicular to the z-axis  (Rdeltaphi) between
      the cluster and Ztrack
        
    - Distance 2 cut (Delta Z for CC delta R for EC)
        cut on maximum distance along the z-direction (Delta Z) for CC and 
      radially (deltaR) for EC between the cluster and Ztrack

    - Shower centroid/track match significance
        cut on a significance paramter. It is computed by adding the two above 
      distances, normalized to their resolution in CC or EC, in quadrature.
      For example in CC:

        significance=sqrt((Rdeltaphi/resolution(Rdeltaphi)**2 +
                          (delta Z/resolution of delta Z)**2)

    - Shower centroid/track match significance of second track
        Set if any another track in the road (excluding the primary track) 
      passes the tack match significance cut.

    - number of tracks in a cone of dR
        Cut on the maximum number of Ztracks allowed in a cone of size dR
        around the electron cluster.

    - CDC/FDC/VTX ionization (MIP)
       is used to reject conversion electrons and is a double sided cut.

    - TRD information available 
        is set in case of unavailability of information due to TRD problems.

    - TRD truncated mean

    - Vertex Transverse impact parameter (in x,y)

    - Vertex Z impact parameter (in Z)
