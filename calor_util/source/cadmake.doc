                        CADMAKE Package

    CADMAKE is a package which rebuilds a CAD bank, provided it can find a
CAEP bank.  It searches for a CAEP bank on the RECO PATH.  The CAD banks are
rebuilt only if no CAD bank is found.  An error message is produced if
CADMAKE is called, but the CAD bank already exists.

    No other packages are required, nor are any RCP banks.

    CADMAKE is based on FLCAD, the routine used in D0GEANT to make
CAD banks.  

NOTES:

    1) The CAD bank will NOT be reconstituted exactly as input if zero
supression was in force when the CAEP bank was made.  Note that the DEFAULT
CAHITS.RCP file, which governs this, has a 100 MeV zero supression per channel
as its default.

    2) Even if no zero supression was used in making the CAEP bank, the vagaries
of rounding might result in single channel differences between an original CAD
bank an a reconstituted CAD bank.  If you REALLY want the original CAD bank, go
back to the RAW tapes.  However, I have been unable to verify any differences.

    3) If you want control of the gain value assumed in building the CAD bank,
you WILL need the CAHITS package and CAHITS.RCP.  However, omitting the RCP file
is not harmful--the CAD banks will be built assuming a default gain, and if you
were to rebuild the CAEP banks from this cad bank, the same CAEP bank as you
started from would result.

    4) This is slow... it takes between 3 and 4 sec/event on a 3100/38.
    
    5) It is also memory-hungry--it takes about 100K words in ZEBCOM to build
       the new CAD banks.
