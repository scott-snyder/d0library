/*
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Identify new text as repetitions of old text within a fixed-
 *      length sliding window trailing behind the new text.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
 *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Thanks to many info-zippers for bug reports and testing.

 *  PURPOSE

 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The PKZIP "deflate" file format interprets compressed file data
 *      as a sequence of bits.  Multi-bit strings in the file may cross
 *      byte boundaries without restriction.
 *
 *      The first bit of each byte is the low-order bit.

 *      be output right-to-left (useful for literal values). For
 *      left-to-right output (useful for code strings from the tree routines),
 *      the bits must have been reversed first with bi_reverse().
 *
 *      For in-memory compression, the compressed bit stream goes directly
 *      into the requested output buffer. The input data is read in blocks
 *      by the mem_read() function. The buffer is limited to 64K on 16 bit

/*
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Encode various sets of source values using variable-length
 *      binary code trees.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The PKZIP "deflation" process uses several Huffman trees. The more
 *      common source values are represented by shorter bit sequences.
 *
 *      Each code tree is stored in the ZIP file in a compressed form
 *      which is itself a Huffman encoding of the lengths of
 *      all the code strings (in ascending order by source values).
 *      The actual code strings are reconstructed from the lengths in
 *      the UNZIP process, as described in the "application note"
 *      (APPNOTE.TXT) distributed as part of PKWARE's PKZIP program.
