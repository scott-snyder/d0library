    The   EVENT_UTIL   library  (part of   GENERAL)  has a  set of  utility
subroutines useful for making and using lists of events. Event lists have a
very simple format:

run_number   number_of_events_in_run
event_id1  event_id2  event_id3 ......
run_number   number_of_events_in_run
event_id1  event_id2  event_id3 ......
    :         :         :
    :         :         :

Example:

43112 4
211 300 411 500
44335 1
125


    The  EV_MERGE_LISTS program will  read lists with  the above format and
merge  them into  one. It  expects a  file  defined to  logical  FILE_NAMES
containing a list of names for the files with event lists.
Example:

$ DEFINE FILE_NAMES FILE_NAMES.LIST

FILE_NAMES.LIST:
EVENT.LIST1
EVENT.LIST2
EVENT.LIST3
  :
  :

the contents of each event list file is as described above. The contents of
the files are  merged and sorted so  that the resulting  file (logical name
EVENT_LIST) has the runs  and events in ascending  order. This file is read
by the PICK_EVENTS package which then writes one file per event on list.

One can create an event list from inside a program selecting events
by simply calling the utility: 

        CALL EV_ADD_TO_LIST(run_number,event_id)

each time you select an event. At the end of job one must then call

        CALL EV_WRITE_LIST

to write the list to the file EVENT_LIST.
