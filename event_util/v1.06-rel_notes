 20-NOV-1989 : Modifications released by Serban D. Protopopescu
 
    - fixed EVTWOS to handle properly user output streams.
    - added new subroutine EVSTRM (maps output stream names to indices)
    - modified EVWRIT so that there is an option to write to EDS output
      stream instead of one event per EVENT.DAT file.
