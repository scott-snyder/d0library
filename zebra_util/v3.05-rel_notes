 29-JUN-1989 : Modifications released by Serban D. Protopopescu
 
    - Added subroutines to handle path in a more general way. There
      are now 3 possible paths to HITS and PROC: RECO (reconstruction),
      GEAN (for D0GEANT generated) and FAKE (generated directly from
      ISAJET information bypassing GEANT).
    _ Subroutines BKPROC and BKHITS now call PATHBK
    - PATHBK will book RECO, GEAN or FAKE depending on path chosen by
      CALL PATHST('bank name'). Default is RECO.
    - PATHGZ integer function with value of supporting bank (depends
      on chosen path), called by GZHITS, GZPROC and GZHSTR
    - MKPATH will book all headers for a given path
