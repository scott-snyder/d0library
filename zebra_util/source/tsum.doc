                        TSUM bank routines

    The TSUM bank contains the names and numbers of all level 1 bits 
and level 2 bits ON in this event.  (For a more precise definition of ON, see
below).  The TSUM bank contains information ONLY about names for this particular
event, so it has to be checked every event.

    GTTSUM fetches the contents of the TSUM bank:

  CALL GTTSUM (NTRIGON,TRIGBON,TRIGNON,NFILTON,FILTBON,FILTNON)

                          possible
                      type values
    NTRIGON            [I] [0:32]   number of trigger bits on
    TRIGBON(i)         [I] [0:31]   ith trigger bit on this event 
        i up to 32
    TRIGNON(i)         [C*32]       names of ith trigger bit  on
    NFILTON            [I] [0:128]  number of filter bits on
    FILTBON(j)         [I] [0:127]  jth filter bits on this event
        j up to 128
    FILTNON(j)         [C*32]       name of jth filter bit on
        since i can range up to 32 and j to 128, dimension accordingly


There are also simpler entry points:
    L1NAME_PASSED(NAME) returns .TRUE. if L1 bit on this event
    L2NAME_PASSED(NAME) returns .TRUE. if L2 bit PASSED this event
                            or, if there is no FILT bank, checks for bit ON
                            (for the distinction, see below)
    L2NAME_ON(NAME)     returns .TRUE. if L2 bit was ON
        (for more detail on the definition of ON, see below)

        GET_L1_BIT_NUMBER(NAME,BITNUM,FOUND)
        GET_L2_BIT_NUMBER(NAME,BITNUM,FOUND)

      given a bit name, returns FOUND = .TRUE. if the bit was ON this event
        If FOUND = .TRUE., then you can use the BITNUM.  

      Note that since the routine GET_L2_BIT_NUMBER checks the length of the
      input character variable and only matches the corresponding part of the 
      filter names in TSUM, partial names of L2 filters are allowable. 

        For example

        CALL GET_L2_BIT_NUMBER('ELE_MEDIUM',EM_MED_BIT,FOUND)
        OK = FOUND
        IF (FOUND) OK = L2BIT_PASSED(EM_MED_BIT)
        IF (OK) THEN
            your code here to look at only level2-certified events
        ENDIF

(The above example has been incorporated into the routines L1NAME_PASSED,
L2NAME_ON and L2NAME_PASSED, which check for bits by name).
        
        so more simply,
        IF (L2NAME_PASSED('JET_MISS') THEN
            either JET_MISS-L20 or JET_MISS-L50 would land you here
        ENDIF

Finally, there is an entry point for getting the lists of the names known as of
this point in the run:

      GET_TRIG_LISTS(L1_LIST,L2_LIST)

    where L1_LIST(0:31) and L2_LIST(0:127) are character*12 arrays containing
the list of known bit names (truncated to 12 characters).  Bits for which no
name has been found (i.e. the bit was never on), contain '............'  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            What ON means: (how the bit names got into TSUM)


ON means that as far as this bit was concerned, the decision was reached to 
WRITE the event:

    Level 1:    a) this level 1 bit fired
                b) this level 1.5 bit fired
            or  c) this was a level 1.5 bit whose level 1 fired, but a decision 
                was not reached before some other bit (level 1 or level 1.5) 
                reached a decision.  In this case you have to look in the
                detailed level 1.5 results to see if the level 1.5 answer was
                really true or false

    Level 2     a) this level 2 bit was passed
                b) this level 2 bit was ON because it was selected as an
                unbiased (by level 2) sample
            or  c) the trigger was not tried (should never happen if we set up
                   the level 2 triggers correctly.  
                To determine the real answer, use the functions
                    L2BIT_PASSED(i) or L2BIT_UNBIASED(i); 
                    see D0$ZEBRA_UTIL:L2BITS.DOC for details

    The TSUM banks are presently attached to events in the Data Logger. If you
run the the level 2 simulation, TSUM will be written with names given by
whatever configuration file you use.
