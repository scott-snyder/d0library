            GTESUM_MATCH.FOR, a new subroutine for matching objects
            -------------------------------------------------------


   GTESUM_MATCH.FOR, a subroutine matching objects of a specified type from
           one ESUM bank with those of another type in another bank,
                         has just been beta-released.
 
      SUBROUTINE GTESUM_MATCH(REF,DTA,ID,CSP,NMX,MRF,MDT,NMC,MATCH,IER)
 
   Inputs  :
              REF   [C*4]   ESUM bank from which objects are to be matched
                            (REF bank is the one where the best-quality
                            objects are expected to be found, eg ISAE or RECO)
              DTA   [C*4]   ESUM bank from which objects are to be matched
              ID(2) [I]     ID of objects to match:
                              ID(1) - object type from REF bank
                              ID(2) - object type from DTA bank
                                See ESUM.PARAMS for object types:
                                INCLUDE 'D0$PARAMS:ESUM.PARAMS'
              CSP   [R]     Cosine of angle within which objects
                            are considered to be matched
              NMX   [I]     Maximum # of objects to match

   Outputs :
         MRF(NMX)   [L]     Status of REF objects --- .TRUE., if matched
                                                      .FALSE. otherwise
         MDT(NMX)   [L]     Status of DTA objects --- .TRUE., if matched
                                                      .FALSE. otherwise
              NMC   [I]     Total # of matches found
   MATCH(NMX*NMX,2) [I]     Matrix with serial #s of matched objects
                              MATCH(I,1) -   Serial # of object from REF
                              MATCH(I,2) -   Serial # of object from DTA
                                You can call GTESUM(REF,ID(1),MATCH(I,1),...)
                                to find the matched object from the REF ESUM
                                bank

              IER   [I]     Error code:
                               0 --- OK
                              -1 --- No ESUM bank of DTA type
                              -2 --- No ESUM bank of REF type
                              -3 --- # of objects in DTA > NMX
                              -4 --- # of objects in REF > NMX
                              -5 --- No objects of type requested in DTA
                              -6 --- No objects of type requested in REF
                              -7 --- Can't ask for matching all objects
                              -8 --- Vertices and ETSUM are not included

   Note:                      more than one from one bank may
                              match one object in the other
