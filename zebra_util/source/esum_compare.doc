                             ESUM_COMPARE Package
                                Version 2.0

News: 
    This version allows matching of different types of objects.

This document can be found in D0$GENERAL:ESUM_COMPARE.DOC

    The new version of the ESUM_COMPARE Package compares any two types of
OBJECTs (including the same type) in any two types of ESUM banks (including the
same type) and produces a number of histograms for the ALL, MATCHed and
UNMATCHed OBJECTs. The types of banks, OBJECTs and histograms required are
controlled by the RCP file, D0$GENERAL:ESUM_COMPARE.RCP. The default RCP
file will compare electrons, muons and jets between ISAE and RECO (ISAJET
and event reconstruction). You can make a simple compare program by
$ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACKAGE=ESUM_COMPARE
$ @ESUM_COMPARE_D0USER.LNK
$ @ESUM_COMPARE_D0USER
$D0USER/FULL
This will run with the default RCP file.

To change the options copy the RCP file to your area and:
$ DEFINE ESUM_COMPARE_RCP ESUM_COMPARE.RCP
after having run the ESUM_COMPARE_D0USER setup file.

Note that if you increase the number of objects you must increase the
size of the PAWC common block as each object needs over 26000 words
if all histograms are requested. This is easily done with
$ PBD/FRAME=D0USER/PACK=ESUM_COMPARE/PAWC=300000

For the conventions used for the names of the banks, OBJECTs and OBJECT_IDs, 
see ESUM.DOC. The package calls the following routines:

    GTESUM, GTESUM_COUNTS, GTESUM_MATCH and ESUM_INIT.

    See the documents, D0$GENERAL:ESUM.DOC and GTESUM_MATCH.DOC, for a
description of these routines.

    A example of the RCP file is given at the end. REF is the reference ESUM
bank, where the objects are expected to be of higher quality than those in the
data bank, DTA. Thus UNMATCHed objects  belonging to the REF bank are referred
to as "LOST", while UNMATCHed objects in the DTA bank are refrred to as
"REJECTED". CSP is the cosine of the space angle, within which objects in
the two banks are considered MATCHed. The IDs of the OBJECTs and their ET
thresholds are specified in the arrays PAIR_#. If PT_SPEC is .TRUE., the
following histograms are generated:

         ID             Histogram Title

         11 (1)   REF-OBJECT Pt-distribution 
         12 (1)   DTA-OBJECT Pt-distribution 
         13 (1)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT Pt-distribution 
         14 (1)   MATCHed-DTA-OBJECT Pt-distribution 
         28 (1)   Integral Eff. (DTA(MATCH)-OBJECTs/REF(TOTAL)-OBJECTs) .vs.
                  Pt of REF-OBJECTs 
         29 (1)   Integral Rej (DTA(TOTAL)-OBJECTs/REF(LOST)OBJECTs) .vs. 
                  Pt of REF-OBJECTs

If LOC is .TRUE., the following histograms showing the location of the MATCHed
and UNMATCHed objects in ETA-PHI space, are generated:

         15 (2)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT PHI-ETA Scatter Plot
         16 (2)   LOST-REF-OBJECT PHI-ETA Scatter Plot   
         17 (2)   REJECTed-DTA-OBJECT PHI-ETA Scatter Plot   
 
And, finally, if RES is .TRUE., the following histograms describing how good the
MATCHing is in various dimensions, are generated:

         18 (2)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT (dPt/Pt)-Pt Scatter Plot
         19 (2)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT d(ETA)-ETA Scatter Plot 
         20 (2)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT d(PHI)-PHI Scatter Plot 
         21 (2)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT d(Cos(Space angle)) .vs. Pt Scatter Plot
         22 (1)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT (dPt/Pt)-Pt Profile Plot
         23 (1)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT d(ETA)-ETA Profile Plot 
         24 (1)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT d(PHI)-PHI Profile Plot 
         25 (1)   MATCHed-REF-OBJECT d(Cos(Space angle))-Pt Profile Plot 
         26 (2)   Pt-Correlation of MATCHed DTA-OBJECTs and REF-OBJECTs 
         27 (2)   d(Pt)/Pt .vs. d(Cos(Space angle)) for MATCHed DTA-OBJECTs
                  and REF-OBJECTs 

    Histograms for each pair of OBJECTs are stored in a separate directory
named, 'REF_OBJECT-DTA_OBJECT'.

    In the example below, if you only wanted to match one pair of objects, you
would just have an 
\ARRAY PAIR_1
        2           12.0         2        12.0        99       12.0       F
\END
 instead of 10 such specifications

The switch  EVENT_LIST in ESUM_COMPARE.RCP can be used to write out an event
list of unmatched objects. The RUN#, EVENT# and a FLAG word are written out for
these events. In the flag word 
    bit 0 is set if a REF object is unmatched
    bit 1 is set if a DTA object is unmatched for the event.

The events with unmatched objects are also written out to the DST, is the
DST output is chosen.


The "REF" and "DTA" objects can be required to match with another object "REQ"
by specifiying a REQUIRED ESUM bank in the REQ field in ESUM_COMPARE_RCP. 
For instance, in the following example, both FILT and RECO objects are required
to have a match with a Level-1 object. The ID and Energy threshold for this 
REQ object should be specified as the 5th and 6th variable of the ARRAY PAIR. 

If you do NOT need to require a match with a third object then specify 99 for 
the object ID or a blank string for the REQ ESUM bank. If the variable "MASK" 
in the ARRAY can be used to specify whether or not both REF and DTA objects are
required to match the SAME REQ object. If MASK is set TRUE, then both REF and
DTA objects are forced to match the SAME REQ object. 

In the example given below, for the first PAIR, RECO and FILT electrons
are compared. A value of 99 for the ID of REQ object turns off any comparisons
with the Level1 objects. In the second and third PAIR, both RECO and FILT
electrons are kept only if they match with a Level-1 electron. The only
difference being that in the second pair the RECO and FILT electrons are
matched with a Level-1 electron, while the third pair enforces that 
a Level-1 electron has a match with both RECO and FILT electrons.
