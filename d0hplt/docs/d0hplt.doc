I. INTRODUCTION

       D0HPLT is the D0 interactive interface to the CERN Histogramming 
   package, HBOOK, and the CERN Plotting package, HPLOT.(ref. 1)  It allows 
   the user to manipulate and display histograms inside the event processing 
   program.  Only selected basic HBOOK and HPLOT features are implemented. 
   The user can plot 1-D and 2-D histograms on a CRT, make hardcopies of
   the plots and start and stop an updating histogram. (See section III. 
   for the current list of commands.)  A post-analysis histogram display
   program, DISPLAY5, is available for the user to display histograms saved
   in a file. It has more commands than D0HPLT. (ref. 3)  
     
     D0HPLT uses COMPACK, the D0 menu system (ref. 4), and the HIGZ-DI3000 
   graphical interface supported by Fermilab. (ref. 5). D0HPLT is linked to
   EXAMINE, the D0 ONLINE Event Monitoring framework, and optionally linked
   into D0USER, the offline analysis framework, if the DI3000 option is
   specified. 

II. LINKING with DI3000

    The DI3000 logicals must be setup before before LINKING 

    1. To set up the DI3000 logicals do:
    
      $SETUP DI3000 (FNAL CLUSTER )
   
    2. To get the shareable high precision version do:

      $DISETSHR EXT HI           


III. SETUP and RUN the program

     One or two DI3000 drivers should be set. The first driver should 
     correspond to the type of terminal you are logged onto; 
     the second one to a hardcopy device

      $SETDRV TYPE1 (TYPE2)

   Some common terminal types and their DI3000 codes are:

       T10 - Tektronix 4010
       240 - VT240
       HDS - Human Devices Systems (Fermilab)
       GPV - UIS VAX Workstation
       XDW - DECWINDOWS VAX Workstation
       TLL - TALARIS, LANDSCAPE MODE      
       LN3 - DEC LN03 LASER PRINTER
       PST - postscript printer

    For more details about DI3000, see D0$DOCS:DI3000_GUIDE.DOC

   If the user wants hardcopies of histograms to be automatically 
   printed on the device chosen as TYPE2, two logicals should be 
   defined: $DEF cod$PRINT  as your local laser printer queue
            $DEF cod$FORM as the graphics form for the same queue
      where cod is the 3 letter DI3000 code for the laser driver.
   Standard values of these logicals for each laser driver should
   be set in D0LOCAL.COM, but can be overridden by the user.

   If the user does not want the hardcopies to be automatically
   printed, but wishes to keep them as disk files, do:

     $DEFINE cod$PRINT DUMMY

   and ignore the warning message about printer queue not defined.

   The files will be named with the code of the printer and extension .DAT
   For postscript, the name of the file is given in the text configuration
   file, DI3_DATA:DRVPST.CFG. (default is DI3K.PS for D0 LACs at Fermilab)

 IV. HISTOGRAM OUTPUT FILES

         When the command STORE HISTOGRAMS is chosen, the program writes
     out the histograms in a ZEBRA file, using the HBOOK4 routine HRPUT.
     Histogram files are labeled with run number and histogram number 
     and have the extension .HST  If the number 0 is entered, all histograms
     are written out, and the file is labeled with the run number only.
     If the command is given again for the same run and histogram number,
     a new output histogram file is written with the same name and the
     next higher version number. The user can choose to store histograms 
     in some directory other than the default directory by setting the LOGICAL
     USR$OUT before running the program:

         $DEF USR$OUT  new_directory
