  *** Picking by keyboard was implemented (JLOCAT modified).  *** Now
      the polygon drawing routines draw real polgons insteas of poly
      -lines (KPLGN was modified, KPLLN was introduced).  *** Some 
      rendering capabilities were added. *** Several new escape
      functions were added (to stop rotations in NUDI3, to extract 
      rotation matrices after 3D rotations).  *** JCONVW was completely
      modified and effect of 3D rotations was included.
