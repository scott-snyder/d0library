                       UISDI3 - Notes for Users

D0$GRAPHICS_UTIL:UISDI3.OLB is a DI3000 emulator library for VAXSTATIONS 
which run VWS software with the UIS graphics interface. 
(If a VAXSTATION is not running XWINDOWS, then it is running VWS/UIS.) 

  To link with this library instead of the standard DI3000, just use:

$LINK PROGRAM,D0$GRAPHICS_UITL:UISDI3/L

To link the UISDI3 emulator with D0USER, use the parameter UIS_DI3000.
(To be impletmented in version V5.37_05 of D0USER)

To use with PIXIE, the D0 event display, (in D0USER, EXAMINE2, or 
user framework) instead of using the DI3000 command $SETDRV,
define the following logical:
$DEFINE YD1DRV DRV_LINK:DRVGPV.EXE
This is a logical that lets the PIXIE Event display program know that
the workstation is UIS.

Any .EXE made by linking with UISDI3 can only be run on VAXSTATIONS with UIS,
in the standard VT200 window. (not with DECWINDOWS system)

Hardcopy can be obtained with the UISDI3 emulator inside PIXIE, the D0 Event
Display, (but not inside PAW, as yet.) The emulator creates a file 
HARDCOPY.PIXIE when the HARDCOPY menu item is chosen in PIXIE. After exiting 
PIXIE, this file must be processed by the DEC standard program RENDER before 
it is printed.

For example:

RENDER HARDCOPY.PIXIE (Show file on WORKSTATION screen)

RENDER/DEV=LN03PLUS/OUT=HARDCOPY.LN3 HARDCOPY.PIXIE
   (Then send the file HARDCOPY.LN3 to the LN03 printer)

RENDER/DEV=LJ250/OUT=HARDCOPY.LJ HARDCOPY.PIXIE
   (Then send the file HARDCOPY.LJ to the LJ250 color printer)

RENDER/DEV=LASERWRITER/OUT=HARDCOPY.PS HARDCOPY.PIXIE
   (Then send the file HARDCOPY.PS to any postscript device queue)

 This has not been extended to the TALARIS printer yet.
