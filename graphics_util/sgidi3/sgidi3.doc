	            D0 EVENT DISPLAY USING SGIDI3 USER GUIDE

I. INTRODUCTION
     D0 EVENT DISPLAY can be run in the Silicon Graphics machines using the 
   DI300 emulator SGIDI3.  This emulator was created to emulate the DI3000 
   calls in the Silicon Graphics machines using GL.   


II. SETUP D0 EVENT DISPLAY
     To setup the needed STP files and RCP logicals you should execute:
    % $d0graphics_util/sgidi3/setup_pixie
   
III. SETUP DATA FILE
     To setup your data file you should do:
    % ln -sf /usr5/lupe/sta_k_18001_01.gen pixie_datafile

    where sta_k_18001_01.gen is the data file you want to use.

IV. GETTING A D0 EVENT DISPLAY USING SGIDI3  
    There will be an executable ready for running in the library so after the setup
    you can just:
    % $d0graphics_util/sgidi3/pixie_display

     If you want to create an executable you should:
    % $d0graphics_util/sgidi3/pixie.bld
    the executable name will be pixie_display
