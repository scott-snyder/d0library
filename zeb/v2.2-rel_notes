 21-OCT-1988 : Modifications released by Olivier Callot
 
    - Creation of  a new group  PIXIE, to  describe the  banks used in the new
      event display program  to describe the screens  layout. These banks will
      reside in the private pixie common  ZEBPIX, and thus don't interfer with
      any other ZEBRA structure.
