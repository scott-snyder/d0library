                     MULTIPLE INTERACTION TOOL
                  ================================


I. Introduction

    To help users distinguish  single-interaction from multiple-interaction
  events  a  multiple   interaction tool  has  been  written that  combines
  information   from  the  L0  detector,  the  Central   Detectors  and the
  calorimeter. The information this  tool provides is in the same format as
  the information returned by the LEVEL 0 tool, i.e. a probability flag. 

     This tool was developed because the information from the current Level
  0  tool is not accurate  enough due to the  limited information available
  to LEVEL 0. In the  multiple-interaction tool described in this note, the
  information   from the  D0RECO  VERTEX   package, which  was  designed to
  precisely   determine  the  primary  vertex  position  and  determine the
  position   of  other   vertices in  the  event  if  they  exist,  and the
  information from  LEVEL 0 and  the  calorimeter are  combined to obtain a
  more accurate   discrimination  between  single and  multiple interaction
  events.

    The multiple interaction tool is essentially one routine that returns a
  flag value indicating whether or  not a particular reconstructed D0 event
  is a single  or multiple  interaction. The  information  used is obtained
  primarily from the  central tracking vertex  banks and the Level 0 banks.
  There is also a check on the total  energy seen by the calorimeter if the
  information is available. 

    The tool is  designed to work on  DSTs or STAs. It  can also be used on
  raw data, if the VERTEX and LEVEL0  packages have been called before this
  tool.

    Since there is  currently no simulation of the  Level 0 in D0Geant that
  generates the  required  information for  Level 0 banks,  the tool is not
  verified by  the Monte  Carlo data.  We will  re-tune the  tool for Monte
  Carlo  data as soon as the Level 0 simulation in D0GEANT is available.


II. How to use the tool:

    To use the  tool, just  include  the following  lines in  your analysis
  program:

  (at the top of your routine)

    INTEGER MI_TOOL, MULTIPLE_INTERACTION_TOOL
    EXTERNAL MULTIPLE_INTERACTION_TOOL

  (when you want the result)

    MI_TOOL = MULTIPLE_INTERACTION_TOOL()

    The tool's basic  response is a  flag value  indicating the possibility
  for the number of interactions in this event.

    The values returned from MULTIPLE_INTERACTION_TOOL() are:

    0 - no vertex information or a failure
    1 - most likely a single interaction
    2 - likely a single interaction
    3 - likely a multiple interaction
    4 - most likely a multiple interaction


III. Algorithm of the tool:

    The events returning  flag=1,2,3 0r 4 are  evaluated using the  Level 0
  multiple interaction  flag, the Level 0 Slow Z  value,  the CD Z value of
  the primary  vertex, and the  weights,  number of tracks,  and other data
  from all of the  stored CD primary  vertices. The  algorithm is presented
  below and represents  the results of studies  performed on low luminosity
  and high  luminosity global  runs at D0.  The Level 0  makes its decision
  based on information collected at  relatively high eta (1.9 to 4.3) while
  the  CD   information is   provided  mostly  by the  CDC  which  subtends
  relatively  low eta  (|eta|<1.4). These  are  complimentary systems which
  have different  advantages and  problems but can be  combined effectively
  for this tool.

    The algorithm starts out by  dividing all events based on the number of
  vertices that the central tracking finds. A few useful abbreviations used
  in the explanation of the algorithm are:

    CD Z     - central tracking Z vertex by either CDC or FDC
    CDC Z    - primary vertex z position if found by CDC
    FDC Z    - primary vertex z position if found by FDC
    CDC wgt1 - fraction of tracks used to form primary CDC vertex
    CDC wgt2 - fraction of tracks used to form second CDC vertex
    Slow Z   - Level 0 Slow Z vertex position
    MI Flag  - Level 0 Multiple Interaction flag value (1-4, similar to above)

    The algorithm makes use of the  various pieces of information depending
  on the level  of agreement  between the  Level 0 and the  CD results. The
  algorithm is shown below in tree form.

  - If there are ZERO CD vertices found:

    TOOL = MI Flag, if Level 0 is good else it is set to 0.

  - If there is ONE CD vertex found:

      If Level 0 bad then TOOL = 2
 
      If Level 0 is good then
        TOOL = MI Flag, if 1=<MI Flag=<3

        For MI Flag = 4, if CDC finds vertex then TOOL=3,  
                         if FDC then TOOL = 4

      If none of these, then TOOL = 2

  - If there are TWO CD vertices found:


      If Level 0 bad then TOOL = 3

      If Level 0 is good then

         For MI Flag = 1, 
             if | CDC Z - Slow Z | < 8.0 cm then TOOL = 2, else = 3

         For MI Flag = 2, 
             if | CDC Z - Slow Z | < 8.0 cm then 
                     if CDC wgt1 >= 0.70 then TOOL = 2, else = 3
             if | CDC Z - Slow Z | >= 8.0 cm then 
                     if ( CDC wgt1 - CDC wgt 2 ) / CDC wgt1 < 25 
                     then TOOL = 4, else = 3

         For MI Flag = 3, TOOL = 3

         For MI Flag = 4, TOOL = 4

      If none of these, then TOOL = 3

  - If there are THREE CD vertices found:

      If Level 0 bad then TOOL = 4

      If Level 0 is good then

         For MI Flag = 1, 
             if | CDC Z - Slow Z | < 8.0 cm then TOOL = 2, else = 3

         For MI Flag = 2, 
             if | CDC Z - Slow Z | < 8.0 cm and CDC wgt1 >= 0.70 
             then TOOL = 2, else = 3

         For MI Flag = 3, TOOL = 4

         For MI Flag = 4, TOOL = 4

      If none of these, then TOOL = 4

  - If the total energy in the calorimeter is available or calculable:

      If Energy > 1800.0 then TOOL = 4
