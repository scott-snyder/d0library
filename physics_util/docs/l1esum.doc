There are two ESUM banks which have level 1 trigger information, TRGR and
TRG2.

The routine L1ESUM_TRGR is used to create an event summary bank from an 
existing TRGR bank (from data or L1SIM).  L1 extracting routines, found in the
ZEBRA_UTIL library, are used to unpack the hot tower candidate list and 
get the energy of TOTAL ET hot towers and total EM hot towers, and to convert 
the trigger tower index to eta and phi.  Additionally, the scalar et,
missing et and LEVEL 0 vertex are unpacked.  All objects are placed into 
the esum bank, with EM hot towers counted as both electron and photon objects.
The et of the trigger towers is not vertex corrected.  Since the jet and
em objects are taken from the hot tower candidate list packed in the TRGR
bank, the tower listed in ESUM TRGR depend strongly on the trigger set used.  
For example, if EM trigger fired for a given event but was prescaled away,
no electron or photon objects will be recorded, even though the event may 
have had EM hot towers.  For jet and em towers, the value of eta and
phi that are recorded correspond to the center of the trigger tower.  For
run 1b, the large tile et is stored as a JET_1 object.

Level 1 muon trigger information is also stored.  The muon triggers can occur
in seven eta regions, (see D0 Note #1591), and within four (or eight for 
central) phi seqments.  As with the trigger towers, the center of the
triggering region is used for the nominal eta and phi position.  Use
these values of eta and phi only to indicate what region the trigger occured
in.  It can happen that there are more than one muon triggers in an eta region
that went through the same phi segment.  When that occurs, a factor is
added to the nominal center phi value so that the muon trigger information
is added to the ESUM bank (otherwise the ESUM bank would throw away the 
second muon as identical to the first.)  When an overlap phi occurs,
the quality word will have lowest bit set.  It can also happen that an
extra phi segment occurs when the multiplicity in an eta region is greater
than three.  If this happens, the second lowest bit will be set in the
quality word.

The nominal eta for the seven regions are:

  SN     ON     WN    C    WS    OS    SS
 -2.9  -2.05  -1.35  0.0  1.35  2.05   2.9

and the nominal phis are
for central :
  0.39  1.17  1.96  2.75  3.52   4.36  5.1  5.84
and for the iregions with quads
  0.78   2.34   3.92  5.5

The routine for filling the ESUM TRGR bank for will be called from the 
Level 2 framwork such that the bank will be filled automatically for the
user either in the level 2 for data or by VMS_FILTER for Monte Carlo data.

The second ESUM bank containing level 1 information is the TRG2 ESUM bank
which contain all of the electromagnetic trigger towers that are greater
than 2.5 GeV and all of the total et trigger towers that are greater than 
3 GeV, regardless of the specifics of the trigger conditions.  In this
case, the em trigger towers are only entered as ELECTRON objects.  The
total et towers are entered as JET objects.  The routine that fills
the ESUM TRG2 bank is L1ESUM_TRG2 and is called from RECO_HSUM_FILL,
so that this bank is filled from the RECONSTRUCTION, not LEVEL2. 

Please recall that in this case, hot trigger towers refers to towers that
that the level1 trigger saw as having energy deposited in them.
