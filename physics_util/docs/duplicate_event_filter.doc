                       DUPLICATE_EVENT_FILTER package
 
This package removes duplicate events, based on run and output event number, 
from the event stream.  It does this by keeping a random access sorted list 
of run and event numbers in an RZ file.  The same RZ file may used and 
updated over several jobs.

By default, Monte Carlo files are not filtered, since they often contain
duplicate run and event numbers.  This behaviour can be changed by an RCP
parameter.
