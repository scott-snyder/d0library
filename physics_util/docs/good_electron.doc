           Documentation for GOOD_ELECTRON and GOOD_PHOTON routines
           ________________________________________________________

    These routines can be used, in conjunction with the COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY
    package, to select isolated electrons or photons using standard
    shape/tracking cuts. They are logical functions that return true, if the
    candidate passed the selected cuts.

    syntax:

    STATUS = GOOD_ELECTRON(LPELC,TYPE)

    LPELC -> address of PELC or PPHO bank to check
    TYPE  -> one of the following strings, selects type of cuts
             'TIGHT'       - tight shape cuts + track match cut
             'LOOSE'       - loose shape cuts + track match cut
             'TIGHT_NOTRK' - tight shape cuts (no tracking cuts)
             'LOOSE_NOTRK' - loose shape cuts (no tracking cuts)
                                
    STATUS = GOOD_PHOTON(LPPHO,TYPE)

    LPPHO -> address of PPHO bank to check
    TYPE  -> one of the following strings, selects type of cuts
             'TIGHT'       - tight shape cuts 
             'LOOSE'       - loose shape cuts 

    tight shape cuts: * tight H-matrix cut (bit 1 in CLEANEM mask)
                      * EM fraction cut (bit 3)
                      * isolation cut on energy in cone of radius 0.4 (bit 7)
                      * number of cells (bit 12)
    loose shape cuts: * loose H-matrix cut (bit 0)
                      * EM fraction cut (bit 3)
                      * isolation cut on energy in cone of radius 0.4 (bit 7)
    track match cut:  * track match significance (bit 18)

    The shape cuts are identical for electrons and photons.
    To obtain the standard cuts, include the package COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY
    before the user package, which calls GOOD_ELECTRON, and use the CLEANEM RCP
    file in D0$CALOR_OFF:CLEANEM.RCP. For a detailed description of all cuts
    made by COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY, see CLEANEM.DOC in D0$CALOR_OFF$DOCS. 

    Please send comments and suggestions regarding GOOD_ELECTRON and 
    GOOD_PHOTON to FNALD0::ULI.
