                        UNIX_UTILITY package

This package contains utility code for unix machines.  This code does nothing
in VMS.  There are three components:

                1) Stack traceback printing
                2) Graceful shutdown by user
                3) Output flushing
 
o Stack Traceback

   This section causes a traceback dump (See dbx 'where') if a segmentation
   violation occurs.  It is enabled if the RCP parameter INSTALL_SEGV_TRACEBACK
   is set to TRUE.  Furthermore, if DISABLE_COREDUMP is TRUE, then no coredump
   is made.

o Graceful Shutdown

   Under some circumstances a user may wish to stop a job before it is 
   completed.  This section causes EVTIN to return end-of-file when the 
   program receives the POSIX signal USR2 (eg, via kill -USR2 <pid>).  This
   functionality is optional and controlled by the RCP parameter 
   INSTALL_CLEANSTOP.

o Flusher

   This section flushes output to the standard output and standard error 
   streams after every N events (N an RCP parameter) on UNIX.  It does nothing
   in VMS.  Its purpose is to make redirected output streams readable from 
   a disk file while a job is running.
