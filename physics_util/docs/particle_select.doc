                      PARTICLE_SELECT package


This package makes a list of the reference links to GOOD OBJECTS 
(ELECTRONS, PHOTONS, JETS AND MUONS) in an event.

These links are then stored in the ZLINKA area which are accessible 
to any subsequest user analyses packages.
                        
The selection of GOOD objects are based on the kinematic quantities 
and  GOOD object MASKs obtained from PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP. 

For electron and photons the routine CHECK_EM_QUALITY is used to test the MASK
and therefore it is upto the user ensure that the status word in PELC and PPHO
have been correctly written. To recompute the PELC and PPHO status word, link in
the package COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY before this package.

For muons, the routine CHECK_MU_QUALITY is used and therefore the package
COMPUTE_MU_QUALITY should be linked in before this package.

Limitations:
------------

    The maximum number of different ELECTRON types is 5
    The maximum number of different PHOTON types is 5
    The maximum number of different MUON types is 5

    The maximum number of LINKS stored for each object type is 20.

How to get the OBJECT links stored by this package:
--------------------------------------------------

To obtain the list of links to GOOD objects from the user analysis 
package one can use the routine GTSLINK. 
     
For example:

 to get the links of GOOD MUONS
--------------------------------     
         
         CALL GTSLINK(object_name,nwant,nmuon,muon_links)
          
          input     object_name CHAR*8 : name of object link defined by the
                            parameters MUON_NAMES in PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP
                    nwant    : maximum number of links wanted

          returns   nmuon    : number of selected muons
                    muon_links[1:nwant] : is the array of links to the 
                                          selected muons

 to get the links of GOOD JETS
--------------------------------     
         CALL GTSLINK('TOP_JETS',nwant,njets,jet_links)
         

         input : Object : 'TOP_JETS'

                nwant   : maximum number of links reurned in jet_links

          returns   njets    : number of selected jets
                    jet_links[1:nwant] : is the array of links to the 
                                          selected jets

  **Note**  the cone size of the jets is selected using the 
            JET_ALGORITHM RCP parameter in PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP

 to get the links of GOOD ELECTRONS
--------------------------------     
         CALL GTSLINK(ELE_TYPE,nwant,nele,ele_links)
         
         input : ELE_TYPE = e.g.
                            'ELE_TGHT'  for tight electron CLEANEM elemask as 
                             stored in PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP
                            'ELE_LSE'  for loose electron CLEANEM elemask as 
                             stored in PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP
                *Note*:  The names of these object type is RCP driven so
                        it is user dependent
                
                nwant   : maximum number of links reurned in ele_links

         output:    nele    : number of selected electrons 
                    ele_links[1:nwant] : is the array of links to the 
                                          selected electrons

 to get the links of GOOD PHOTONS
--------------------------------     
         CALL GTSLINK(PHOT_TYPE,nwant,nphot,phot_links)
         
         input : PHOT_TYPE =e.g.
                            'GAM_TGHT'  for tight photon CLEANEM phot-mask as 
                             stored in PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP
                            'GAM_LSE'  for loose photon CLEANEM phot-mask as 
                             stored in PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP

                *Note*:  The names of these object type is RCP driven so
                        it is user dependent
                
                nwant   : maximum number of links reurned in phot_links

         output:    nphot    : number of selected photons 
                    phot_links[1:nwant] : is the array of links to the 
                                          selected photons
