    EMFIX :

    This is a function to fix the KNOWN problems to date in the electron/photon
    reconstruction using the USING the CAPHEL and the HMATRIX package.


    More specifically it OVERWRITES the following information in the PELC/PPHO
    banks with version 2. 

    a) Replace Theta, eta and phi in PELC/PPHO/CACL with those computed 
       using the log weighted shower centroid information.

    b) For PPHO banks the calorimeter eta word and the shower centroid
       information, if missing, is filled.
    

    PELC/PPHO banks with version 1 are updated to  version to 2 and the 
    following information is added.

    a) calorimeter eta

    b) log weighted shower centroid

    c) Replace Theta, eta and phi in PELC/PPHO/CACL with those computed 
       using the log weighted shower centroid information.


    Finally, the Hmatrix Chisq and chisquare truncated are recomputed using the
    41x41 matrix for ALL PELC/PPHO banks
