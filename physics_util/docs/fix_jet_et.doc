                       FIX_JET_ET package

This package recalculates the ET's of jets and modifies the corresponding
JETS banks accordingly.  All jet algorithms are recalculated and SET_CAPH/
RESET_CAPH are not called.  The RCP file gives a choice of ET definitions.
The default definition is PT ( = SQRT(PX**2 + PY**2), which has been adopted
by the TOP group as the standard definition of jet ET.  Refer to the RCP
file for the other choices.
