                       RUN_SELECT package

    This package allows the selection of "good runs" based on the following
criteria:

1.  Minimum and maximum run numbers in up to 5 separate ranges.

2.  Bad run list.

This package was adapted from TOP_LEPTONS and used the TOP_LEPTONS bad run
list as its default bad run list.  This list has been continuously updated to
include data taken thru Run 1b and 1c.  Also, a selection mask is now
provided for the user to more easily pick bad runs from the larger, more general
list. The code is completely backward compatible and understands the old style
BAD_RUN.RCP without this mask, as long as the old style RUN_SELCT.RCP is also
used.  The files involved in the RUN_SELECT package are:

D0$PHYSICS_UTIL$GENERAL:RUN_SELECT.FOR
D0$PHYSICS_UTIL$GENERAL:RUN_SELECT.RCP
D0$PHYSICS_UTIL$DOCS:RUN_SELECT.DOC

D0$PHYSICS_UTIL$GENERAL:BAD_RUN.RCP
D0$TOP_PHYSICS:BAD_RUN.RCP      (obsolete)

D0$PBD:RUN_SELECT.PBD

===========================================================================

Notes about BAD_RUN.RCP:

    The package RUN_SELECT requires an rcp file, called BAD_RUN.RCP, which 
lists runs which are undesireable for analysis purposes.  This list has been 
generated for run 1b using a variety of sources to obtain the most complete 
description of each run's suspected or known problems.  Sometimes the 
information is poor or unclear and so in some cases a best guess is attempted.
    The initial source for bad run information in Run 1b is the GM shifter run 
summary comments in the Run-Summary Database. This list is augmented by 
a list of special runs for Run 1a and 1b, the original 1a BAD_RUN list, and
the 1a bad run list from the QCD group which was more complete.  The 
information from the run summary database is not always conclusive and so it 
has been necessary to consult the DAQ shifter's logbook extensively about 
various issues.  The main uses for the DAQ logbook are to get information about:

          1)  status of online system
                -- L0, L1, L1.5, L2 issues ...

          2)  DAQ-related hardware issues
                -- VBD's, MAC cards ...

          3)  detector download and general status

          4)  special runs to identify trigger list

Also, some new runs were added using the DAQ logbook.
    For some runs the status is still unclear.  In addition to the above 
sources, a thorough search has been necessary thru the logbooks of the GM and 
DET shifter's for further information about the status of hardware, trigger
configuration, and other issues.  Early runs are particularly difficult to pin
down and so a coarse DAQ judgement (good/bad/uncertain verdict) has also been 
used before runs 75000 (c/o Sailesh Chopra).  In general the other shifter
logbooks were used as follows:

          1)  DET(ector) shifter's logbook
                -- hardware problems
                -- suspected CALIB runs
                -- confirmation of DAQ or GM statements 
                    or lack thereof

          2)  GM (Global Monitor) shifter's logbook
                -- data quality, hot cells
                -- elaboration of Run-Summary Database

    In the spirit of keeping data unless we know it is bad, there are 
several cases in which the above list can be trimmed.  The overriding
concerns for the bad_run list are: whether the relevant detectors were
operating, whether the data was corrupted, and whether the luminosity 
was screwed up.  If a run is able to be dealt with offline (eg. hot cells, 
deadtime), then it is desireable to keep it. Thus, runs which seem fine but 
have DAQ problems or overall high rates, etc. are kept.  Runs with hot cells are 
kept unless a hardware problem like a BLS card is suspected and caused a large
change in some trigger rate.  Runs with tripping chambers or calorimeter HV 
supplies are also kept if the deadtime is believed to have been properly 
dealt with in the luminosity.  A bad SAMUS, VTX, or TRD is also not enough to 
reject a run -- the TRD group does this bookkeeping internal to TRD analysis
code.
    In order to make the choice of bad runs as user freindly as possible, a user
mask, called clean_run_mask, is implemented in run_select.rcp.  By setting
various bits in this mask, one can toggle the sorts of runs to add to the bad
run list.  Currently, there are 7 bits taken with the following general meaning:
    
    bit 0 = Fails only on minor issues (beam halo large, SAMUS off, etc)
            or status not clear.  obviously, this is a subjective definition of
            minor and that is why spare bits exist.  The sort of things which 
            could end up in this category are:

                no L0 readout
                OTC problems
                TRD, VTX, or SAMUS bad
                MAC card bad in muon system
                CDC readout errors
                1 bad muon module
                high FEB (frount-end-busy) or L2 disable
                hot cells (unless trigger rate screwed up)
                high losses
                HV trips as long as data was not taken with voltage low (run
                    should pause)

    bit 1 = Major MUON system problems.  For the most part, WAMUS not usable
        for muon analyses (HV off, magnets off, etc).  Other examples are:

                WAMUS not readout
                mutcc improperly loaded 

    bit 2 = Major CAL system problems.  Generally one or more cryostat has
        part HV off or triggers messed up.  Other examples are:

                BLS or hot cells leading to high Missing Et or Scalar Et 
                    trigger rate
                cal HV fuse blown
                cal preamp supply off (if we ran like this)

    bit 3 = Major CD system problems.  This involves failure of large portion
        of CDC and/or FDC.  For example,
 
                FDC high voltage off
                CDC readout corrupted (if just readout errors -- then good run)
                # CD tracks low -- bad if really low

    bit 4 = Special runs
    bit 5 = Major DAQ problems.  Examples are:

                L2 corrupt
                trigger framework off
                bad trigger download
                L2 RCP files not downloaded

    bit 6 = Major accelerator problems
    bit 7 = Active veto runs and other runs where data is usable but luminosity
            is difficult to calculate correctly.  Often this is because the 
            luminosity information from a run is incomplete.

    bit 8 = Corrupt L1.5 EF high pt
    bit 9 = Bad MUON_L2 L2_CONFIRM_L1.5
    bit 10 = Corrupt L1.5 SA low pt
    bit 11 = (Reserved-other muon trigger problems)


    The default cuts are an OR of bits 1 thru 7 (mask = $000000FE), with those 
satisfying bit 0 alone being passed.  Analyses unconcerned with difficulties 
in the muon system may consider ignoring bit 1 (mask = $000000FC). 
Bits 8 thru 11 denote sepcial problems which affect some muon analyses.  
The muon ID group should be consulted prior to dropping these runs from 
analysis. In time, people may devise other more 
specific bits for this mask.  Every run stored in BAD_RUN.RCP now has
stored with it the status word which describes what is wrong in 
terms of the above bits.  After this is a short verbal description which 
tries to summarize what is wrong.
