          Top group addendum to D0 analysis and utility packages
          ------------------------------------------------------

        This document contains top group specific information concerning
        the packages described in "D0 analysis and utility packages."
        In addition, two other packages, TOP_BTAG and TOP_LEPTONS are
        described.

        COMPUTE_EM_QUALITY
        ------------------

        The top group has modified three cuts in the standard CLEANEM.RCP.
        These are isolation parameter (0.10 instead of 0.15), H-matrix 
        chisquare (100 for all eta out to 2.5) and track-match-significance
        (5 instead of 10).

        COMPUTE_MU_QUALITY
        ------------------

        The top group has a modified version of CLEANMU.RCP called 
        CLEANMU_BTAG.RCP, which can be found in D0$BETA:[TOP_LEPJTS.CMS].
        CLEANMU_BTAG.RCP is tuned to work for both high pt and soft muons
        simultaneously.

        CAFIX
        -----

        The RCP parameter DO_SOFT_CORRECTION should be set to FALSE
        in CAFIX.RCP.  Other default parameters are OK.

        FIX_JET_ET
        ----------

        The top group standard definition of jet ET is defintion 1
        in FIX_JET_ET.RCP (= pt = sqrt(px**2+py**2)).

        PARTICLE_SELECT
        ---------------

        There is as yet no standard top group PARTICLE_SELECT.RCP.  The 
        following particle names and masks are acceptable to the top group.

        ELE_TGHT  $0004108A   -  Tight electron (data).
        MCE_TGHT  $0004008A   -  Tight electron (Monte Carlo -- no
                                 cut on number of cells).

        GAM_TGHT  $0000108A   -  Tight photon (data).
        MCG_TGHT  $0000008A   -  Tight photon (Monte Carlo -- no
                                 cut on number of cells).

        ISOL_MUO  $002a14b5   -  High pt muon.
        SOFT_MUO  $00088280   -  Soft muon.

        TOP_JETS              -  Jets.

        Note that neither PARTICLE_SELECT nor CLEANMU applies any
        isolation or non-isolation cut to muons, although these are
        required in standard top analyses.

        MUJETS_MU_SELECT
        ----------------

        Applies standard ISOLATED and BTAG muon selection to ISOL_MUO
        and SOFT_MUO as defined in PARTICLE_SELECT.  The resulting 
        ISOLATED and BTAG muon links can be fetched using gtslink or 
        good_particle with the names ISOLMUON and BTAGMUON respectively
        
        TOP_BTAG
        --------

        Electron + jets and muon tag oriented ntuple generating package.  
        Files are in BTAG group of TOP_LEPJTS local CMS area. 

        D0$PBD:TOP_BTAG.PBD
        TOP_BTAG.RCP
        TOP_BTAG.FOR

        TOP_LEPTONS
        -----------

        Steve Wimpenny's TOP_LEPTONS package.  This package "does it all."
        Files are in D0$TOP_PHYSICS$TOP_LEPTONS.  There is some overlap 
        of functionality  with other packages (e.g. RUN_SELECT and 
        PARTICLE_SELECT).
