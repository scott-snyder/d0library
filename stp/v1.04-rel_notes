 12-APR-1991 : Modifications released by A.M.Jonckheere
 
    - Added xxx_D0STPFILE.DAT's for CDC (Qizhong), FDC (Jeff Bantly) and VTX 
      (ED Oltman). These are temporary files that contain alignment data for
      the cosmic ray commissioning run. Eventually, the code to produce these
      files will be placed into STP and the files + MC versions will be
      produced by running EXE's.
