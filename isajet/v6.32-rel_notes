 31-JUL-1990 : Modifications released by Serban D. Protopopescu
 
 This is version 6.32 of ISAJET. The main changes from previous release
 are:
    - Process HIGGS to gamma-gamma has been added
    - The option ISALEP is now integrated into ISAJET. This is a way
      to generate more efficiently higher order processes like b-bbar
      pairs in gluon jets, radiation of W,Z in high pt jets, etc.
      see ISAJET.DOC section [11] for details
    - Some small bugs have been fixed
