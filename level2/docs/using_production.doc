Using the level 2 production area:

    LIBPROD/PREVIOUS L2PROD
    @D0$LEVEL2:SETUP_L2SIM
and proceed more or less as usual, except less stuff will be copied into your
directory.  However, whenever you want to program build, you should really run
setup_l2sim again rather than do it yourself, as the mechanism for getting
patches to the release involves modification to vms_filter_d0user.obj's.
    You may find the release notes in d0$level2 useful.

    The standard .EXE's should be able to process all types of data.  Please
send problems to Amber.

    WARNING: Do not do beta work and production work in the same window.  The
current beta setup has to kludge some logicals by hand in the process logical
table.  These override any work you do for production logicals, as they are in
the LNM$D0_PROD table, and this can confuse things badly.

Level 2 Librarians:
------------------
Put into your login
$ L2prod_setup :== @d0$prod:[d0production.admin_util.l2prod.mgr]l2prod_setup.com

and do
$l2prod_setup when you want to build the environment.
This is not supposed to copy any files to your area.  If you want to do actual
work, go to a private directory and proceed as above.

Then type l2$mgr:l2prod_setup.doc to see what logicals have been defined.

Linking should take place in l2$regular.
Vms linking should take place elsewhere, such as l2$vms if it's official library
work.  (l2$vms not clearly defined yet)
