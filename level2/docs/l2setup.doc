L2SETUP is a fake level 2 tool which does nothing other than provide a
mechanism for downloading parameters into level 2.
    
Previously, character data types were used when COOR did not support
logical data.

    Below are its current parameters and their data times.

TIME_SCRIPT     [L]        TRUE or FALSE whether to do timing script by
                                            script
TIME_TOOL       [L]            "             time tool by tool? 
HISTO_SCRIPT    [L]            "            histogram times for scripts
                                                (assumes TIME_SCRIPT = 'TRUE')
HISTO_TOOL      [L]            "            histogram times for tools
                                                (assumes TIME_TOOL = 'TRUE')
TIMING_TYPE     [C]   'CPU' or 'CLOCK'      what kind of timing to do.
                                            (in ELN, the only option is CLOCK
TMIN_SCRIPT     [R]             lower bound for timing histograms for tools
TMAX_SCRIPT     [R]             upper bound
TMIN_TOOL       [R]             lower bound for timing histograms for scripts
TMAX_TOOL       [R]             upper bound
RAW_TO_DROP     [C]             names of raw data banks to drop eg
                                'CDD2' or 'MUD1_CDD2' or 'TRGRCAD1CAD2'
                                (24 chars or 6 banks max, no blanks)
BANKS_TO_DROP   [C]             names of other banks to drop eg
                                'CAHT' or 'MUHT_CAEP' or 'CAEPCATECAEH'
                                (24 chars or 6 banks max, no blanks)
                                    _ is only allowed delimiter, and is optional
L2_HITFIND      [L]        TRUE or FALSE depending on whether you want the L2
                                hitfinding to run.  RAW_TO_DROP is completely
                                independendent decision.
     

    Note on the histogram bounds:
    
    The units of the timing histograms are millisec.

The timing is quantized in 10msec increments.  Further, many tools and scripts
actually take short times to run, because their results have already been
computed by earlier calls to the same tool.  Thus, it is often convenient to
supress these zeros in the histogram shape by setting tmin to 10.
