                                L2_VERT

    L2_VERT() is a function which returns the best estimate of the vertex
position for use in level 2.  It returns the value of the Z position of the
vertex in cm.

    Usage:
        1) in the INIT phase of your tool, call L2_VERT_INIT
            (this is done for you if you call CL2_INIT)
        2) in the PARAMETERS phase of your tool, call L2_VERT_PARAMETERS
    

Implementation:

    Currently, the vertex comes from level 0 information.  The slow z
information is used if available; if not, fast z information is used; if not,
the current estimate of the average z position is used.  A bank L0VT is produced
to report vertex information, and an ESUM bank is also produced.

    ESUM BANK FLAG WORD:    
        0   used default vertex
        1   used L0 Fast Z
        2   used L0 Slow Z
        3   used CD vertex Z (not yet implemented)
