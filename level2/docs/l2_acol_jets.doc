                            L2_ACOL_JETS

is a high level topological tool used in LEVEL2 filtering.  It is designed to
select events with acollinear jets and reject events with faulty MEt due to
mismeasured jets (vetoing events with MEt-jet alignment in PHI).  Since this 
tool works from the ESUM banks (through GTESUM for the L2 MEt values, and 
GTJAUX for jets) it can be run ONLY in scripts where it is preceeded by 
calls to BOTH the L2JETS and L2EMISS tools.

L2_ACOL_JETS permits rejection against

   1) back-to-back jets      

            through its DEL_PHI_JETS parameter, an opening angle across from 
            the leading jet. The tool loops over all remaining jet candidates 
            in the event,rejecting it if any fall within DEL_PHI_JETS.

   2) jets back-to-back with Missing Et

            by looping over all jets and rejecting the event if any fall 
            within DEL_PHI_MET, a phi window across from the Missing Et 
            direction.

   3) jets aligned with MEt, 

            by not allowing any jets to fall within DEL_PHI_MET_ISO of the 
            Missing Et direction.

    A zero supplied for any of these values renders the cut ineffective.
    It is recommended that the script contain a low threshold jet 
    (say L2JET(1,10)) so that ALL jets (even those below the triggering 
    threshold) will be considered by these cuts.

                            TOOL PARAMETERS
                            ---- ----------

    JET_CONE        [R]     Must match the CORE_DELTA_R size specified
                            in the L2JETS call above it, to guarantee that 
                            the only jet candidates considered by this tool, 
                            are those identified within this script.

    DEL_PHI_JETS    [R]     +/- opening angle across from leading jet within
                            which this tool allows no jets. [RADIANS]

    DEL_PHI_MET     [R]     +/- opening angle across from Missing Et direction
                            within which this tool allows no jets. [RADIANS]

    DEL_PHI_MET_ISO [R]     +/- opening angle around direction of MEt within
                            which this tool allows no jets. [RADIANS]



    Studies of RUN1B data show all of these quantities provide powerful
rejection on JET_MISS triggers, as most events give jet angular distributions 
strongly aligned with (or against) MEt and/or one another.  For signals of
interest under the JET_MISS triggers, distribtions are at worst FLAT with 
respect to these quantities.
