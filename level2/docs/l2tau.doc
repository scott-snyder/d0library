This document is D0$LEVEL2$DOCS:L2TAU.DOC

The level2 tau tool is specifically designed to do topological cuts that
favor events with a W decaying to a tau + neutrino with the tau decaying
to hadrons + neutrino.  We expect the event to have significant missing
transverse energy, and at least one jet.  Consequently, the level 2
missing et tool and the jet tool must have been run before calling the
tau tool.  The tool works from information stored in the Level 2 event
summary (ESUM) bank and from the JAUX bank.


There are six parameters in the tau tool:

JET_RMS_MAX       R   a cut on the RMS of the jet, the RMS must
                      be less than the the value of the cut.
JET_MET_DPHI_MIN  R   A cut on the difference in phi between the missing 
                      energy and the leading jet in the event, the delta 
                      phi must be greater than the value of the cut.
JET_JET_DPHI_MAX  R   A cut on the difference in phi between the leading 
                      jet and the second jet in the event, the delta phi 
                      must be less than the value of the cut.
NUM_JETS_MIN      I   Number of jets which must be present.
JET_ET_MIN        R   The minimum et of the leading jet
MET_MIN           R   The minimum missing energy in the event.

The last three parameters provide checks that the level 2 jet and missing
et tools were run before the tau tool was called.
