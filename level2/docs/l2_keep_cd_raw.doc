    L2_KEEP_CD_RAW is a special-purpose  tool whose only function is to tell the
Level 2  bank  handling  that  it is  not  permitted to  drop  raw CD  data.
This  allows  you to override, on a script-by-script basis, the raw bank
dropping specified in the L2SETUP tool.

    Useage: place this tool LAST in  a script for which you need to retain the
CD  raw data, even if the  Level 2 hitfinding has  taken place.  The tool always
returns TRUE as its filtering result.

    There is only one parameter:

RAW_TO_KEEP     [C]             name(s) of CDDn data banks to drop eg
                                'CDD2' or 'CDD4_CDD2' or 'CDD1_CDD2CDD4'
                                (24 chars max, no blanks allowed)
