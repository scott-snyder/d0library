                                                                    E. James
                                                                    21 Dec 1992

1. PARAMETERS FOR L2_CONFIRM_L15

    NUM_L15_MUONS  [I]  an integer; the minimum number of l15 muons required
    L15_REGIONS    [C]  character string to identify allowed l15 trigger
                        regions

  a) NUM_L15_MUONS is simply the number of l15 triggers that one requires to
     pass this particular filter bit. Note the following restriction that
     for a given trigger region one may only count to a set number as follows:

     region   max count
     ------   ---------
      CF         2
      WN         1
      WS         1
      ON         2
      OS         2
      SN         2
      SS         2                 

     As described below, however, more than one trigger region can be chosen
     for each individual filter bit so it is possible to choose this parameter
     to be a number larger than two.

  b) L15_REGIONS is a character string that identifies the trigger regions in
     which one may look for l15 triggers. The format of this character string
     is similar to the character string used to pass along this information
     in the level 1 and level 1.5 trigger configuration files. The format is
     as follows:

     (XX) 
     or
     (XX+XX) 
     or
     (XX+XX+XX)   
     or
     ...  
     (XX+XX+XX+XX+XX+XX+XX)

     where the XX refers to a two element character string describing a 
     certain portion of the muon trigger system. When more than one two
     element set is used the different portions represented by the different
     character sets are simply added together. The character sets which
     may be used are as follows:

     character set      region
     -------------      ------
         CF               CF
         WN               WN
         WS               WS
         ON               ON
         OS               OS
         SN               SN
         SS               SS
         Y1               CF
         Y2               CF+WN+WS
         Y3               CF+WN+WS+ON+OS
         Y4               CF+WN+WS+ON+OS+SN+SS

     note that the two element character sets should always be entered 
     in capital letters.
