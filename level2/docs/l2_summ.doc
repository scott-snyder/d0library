                        L2_SUMM package

    The purpose of the L2_SUMM package is to scan a data file and reconstitute a
summary based on the level 2 output bits.  This is unnecessary if such a summary
has been collected at the time of the run.  This will produce wrong numbers
unless a) ALL the events went to this stream b) they were all in MARK and PASS
mode, i.e. PASS_1_OF 1 in the .FILT files.

    Within these limitations, the reconstruction results in a normal-looking
filter summary.  The numbers for L2 BIT pass rates are the most reliable, as
they are independent of any attempts to reconstruct the filter scripts at the
time of the data run.  Similarly, the overall filtering numbers should be
correct.  

The level 1 bit numbers are reconstructed based on
        a) if available, trig_filt_run.INFO 
        b) if not, what was given in the configuration file in you area

    The tool names and parameter set numbers in the display are based on what
you put into your configuration file.  If they do not match the actual script,
then the reconstructed information will be faulty.  Even worse, there is a real
danger that even if they DO reproduce the actual scripts, there may still be
discrepancies.  This is because the tool-level reconstruction is based on the
information recorded in the FRES bank, which records the last tool which is run
on each event.  This recording is done in terms of the tool number in the
L2TOOL.DAT which was use to build the ACTUAL script executed in the node.  Thus
confusion will reign if the tool ID numbers in YOUR L2TOOL.DAT do not match
those in the original one.

Technical requirements:

    Set up for a VMS_FILTER run (probably via SETUP_L2SIM).  The configuration
file you choose should be as close as possible to what was actually run.  The
L2_SUMM package is a canibalized version of VMS_FILTER, so it requires things
like VMS_FILTER_INIT.FOR and VMS_FILTER_PARAMETERS.FOR .
