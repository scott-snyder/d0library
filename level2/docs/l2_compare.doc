                    Guide to the L2_COMPARE package

This package was written to aid in tracking changes to the Level 2 code.
The basic philosophy is that there should be a standard data set which
has been run through either L1/L2 or simulation, containing the results
banks (such as FILT, FRES, etc.).  Running this data set again through
the simulation using both RERUN_L12 before the simulation packages and
L2_COMPARE afterwards will produce a file called L2_COMPARE.OUT which contains
an event-by-event comparison of   the results.    L2_COMPARE.OUT   is  132
characters wide.

Control over L2_COMPARE is though the L2_COMPARE_RCP file.  Various flags will
allow the user to:

    o (dis)able the various banks checked;
    o (dis)able filling of a Level 1 trigger matrix to see what the
      level 1 overlaps are - two 2-d histograms are booked and filled,
      one for each "run" of the L1 filter;
    o direct output to the terminal or to a file;
    o set tolerances for comparing REAL variables

    see D0$LEVEL2:L2_COMPARE.RCP

Note that it may be desirable (or advisable!) to change the L1SIM.RCP
parameter from

 \ARRAY L1SIM_INPUT_SOURCE_DEFAULT
    'ANY'
 \END

 to
 \ARRAY L1SIM_INPUT_SOURCE_DEFAULT
    'CAD'
 \END

Output:  On an event by event basis, events banks are compared.  If there
are discrepancies, information is output to L2_COMPARE.OUT (or to the screen
depending on what you select in L2_COMPARE.RCP - see comments there).  The
output is a comparison of the bits for the TRGR and FILT bank in ascii
representation (you'll see!), and a dump of the contents of the banks for
JAUX and L2EM.
