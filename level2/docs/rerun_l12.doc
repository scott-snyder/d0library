                        RERUN_L12 Package

    The purpose of this package is to make it possible to re-run VMS_FILTER on
data which has already been passed through the level 2, or its simulation.  A
similar service is performed for level 1 and its simulation.   This enables
comparisons with the online answers, or comparisons of two successive runs.

    To accomplish this, two things are done:
1) the NAME field in any ESUM banks which are found are changed as follows:

TRGR -> OTRG    (the O is for Old)
TRG0 -> OTR0
FILT -> OFLT

This means that any newly-produced ESUM banks have distinct names and can be
compared.

2) a new FILT bank is booked with an appropriate path under it.  Thus any banks
   under the two FILT banks may compared by adroit ZEBRA handling.

    Similar action is not needed for the level 1 simulation, as L1SIM simply
books a new TRGR bank as a member of a linear chain.
