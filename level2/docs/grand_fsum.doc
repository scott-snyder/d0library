                        Grand Filter Summary

    Files  containing the basic  information  for making  filter summaries are
 written by the package VMS_FILTER. They are called FSUM_runnum.DAT

    The package  GRAND_FSUM adds  or subtracts  them as  requested in the file
 GRAND_FSUM.RCP under control of  "ACTION" ("SUM" to add, "DIFF" to subtract).
 Depending on which "action" you choose, you will get either GRAND_FSUM.OUT or
 GRAND_FDIFF.OUT.  Link ALONE (NO  other package in the  frame). To do the PBD
 run and link, you will  first have to do  @d0$level2:setup_l2sim, or run your
 local copy of  l2lib_setup.com,  and then be sure  that the directory you are
 running in contains the correct files associated with the trigger used to run
 the event: trigger.info,  run_filter.dat, l2tool.dat, and trig_filt_run.info;
 if necessary, rerun coor_sim. Otherwise, the summary will be cobbled together
 with the wrong bits and the wrong names.

    GRAND_FSUM reads one event from a data file to get the level 2 environment
 (names, filter scripts etc) set up, but on getting the first event writes the
 summary and stops.  This is just an  easy way to hook  into all of the  stuff
 that the  framework provides.  Reading the  event is simply  to force calling
 GRAND_FSUM  at the right  time (e.g.  the end of  the job). So  only read one
 event, and it doesn't matter if it's a DST or whatever.

    The files to  add are  defined in  GRAND_FSUM.RCP; copy to  your directory
 from  d0$level2$source modify as needed.

    For now,  the weighting  is  directly from  Isajet; and  there should be a
 facility for adding  prescale info, non-isajet  weighting, and etc. Note that
 there is an item in the .OUT files which refers to the TIME for 100K SQRTs or
 to D0 units of time.    This is the time that it took to run the  filter
 divided by the time it took to do a DO-LOOP over 100,000 SQRTs as a way of 
 normalizing. The purpose of this is mainly for the "DIFF"  action - to track 
 changes to the  filters. If the time in in these units suddenly increases, we
 will want to know this. Normalizing this way allows you to compare when
 running in different conditions (machine load, or perhaps cpu).
